1
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:27,230
Oh, hello.

2
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:29,070
You're, uh, you're probably here

3
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:31,110
About the, Uh, the story.

4
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:33,070
Elves love to tell stories.

5
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:35,790
I- I'll bet you didn't know that
about elves.

6
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:38,030
There's, uh, probably a lot of things

7
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:40,190
You... you didn't know about elves.

8
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:44,670
Another... another interesting
Uh, elf ism

9
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:49,910
Uh, there are only three jobs available
to an elf.

10
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:51,470
The first is making shoes at night

11
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:53,030
While, you know, while the old....

12
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:54,590
The old cobbler sleeps.

13
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:57,550
Lazy bum. Couldn't even make a clog.

14
00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:59,110
You can bake cookies

15
00:00:59,150 --> 00:00:59,870
In a tree. Hey!

16
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:02,910
As you can imagine, it's, uh, dangerous
Having an oven

17
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:05,270
In an oak tree during the dry season.

18
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:06,910
I wanna make shoes!

19
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:09,390
But the third job... uh, some call
It, uh,

20
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:11,550
"The show," or... or "the big dance,"

21
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:15,510
It's the profession that every elf
Aspires to,

22
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:19,470
And that is to build toys in
Santa's workshop.

23
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:21,630
Only two weeks left till Christmas!

24
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:24,990
I- It's a job only an elf can do.

25
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:26,350
Our... our nimble fingers,

26
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:28,030
Natural cheer and active minds

27
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:29,670
Are perfect for toy-building.

28
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:32,550
They... they tried using gnomes
And trolls,

29
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:35,310
But the gnomes drank too much...

30
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:39,470
...and the trolls weren't toilet
trained.

31
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:44,870
No human being has ever set... set
foot in Santa's workshop.

32
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:47,590
Uh, that is until about 30 years ago,

33
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:50,430
And, as you may have guessed,

34
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:53,270
That's where our story begins.

35
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:25,470
Wow!

36
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:29,630
Whoa!

37
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:06,110
Ooh!

38
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:07,630
Wow!

39
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:09,150
Wow!

40
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:19,790
Ow! Ow!

41
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:34,510
Whoa!

42
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:39,430
Are you sleepy?

43
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:41,110
Here we are.

44
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:45,550
We're just going to make you feel
so comfortable.

45
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:47,510
Here we are.

46
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:49,430
There you are.

47
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:52,550
It's time to go to sleep.

48
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:55,950
Maybe by next Christmas you'll
Have a home.

49
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:05,830
Merry Christmas, my ángel.

50
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:34,030
Mmm...

51
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:13,710
All right, all right.

52
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:17,110
We've had another very successful
year.

53
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:21,310
So, after all that hard work,

54
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:23,790
It's time to start preparations

55
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:25,350
For next Christmas!

56
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:38,350
What in the name of Sam hill
Is that?

57
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:42,030
Wow...

58
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:46,870
A baby...

59
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:51,630
"little buddy diapers."

60
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:53,670
His name is buddy. He must've...

61
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:55,990
Snuck into your sack at the
orphanage.

62
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:56,430
What do we do?

63
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:59,470
So, Santa had a
Decision to make,

64
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:01,510
And fortunately, when it
Comes to babies,

65
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:02,750
Santa's a... a pushover.

66
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:04,910
So, buddy stayed with, uh
An older elf

67
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:05,790
Who had always wanted a child?

68
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:08,270
But had been so committed to
Building toys, he...

69
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:12,910
He, well, had forgotten to
Settle down.

70
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:13,470
Santa.

71
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:16,630
Yes, yes, I... I raised buddy.

72
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:18,750
I was his adopted father.

73
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:20,430
Though buddy grew twice as fast,

74
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:24,510
He... he wasn't any different from
the other children.

75
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:27,070
Chuckles not too fast, buddy.

76
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:29,550
I mean, not... not really.

77
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:31,390
Before we learn how to build
The latest

78
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:33,630
In extreme graphic chipset
Processors,

79
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:35,830
Let's recite the
"Code of the elves,"

80
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:36,670
Shall we?

81
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:37,430
Number one.

82
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:40,310
"Treat every day like Christmas."

83
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:41,030
Number two.

84
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:44,910
"There's room for everyone on the
Nice list."

85
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:45,950
Number three.

86
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:49,230
"The best way to spread Christmas
Cheer

87
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:52,910
Is singing loud for all to hear."

88
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:55,670
And one day, when buddy was
old enough,

89
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:57,790
I made him my own personal
apprentice.

90
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:59,790
I've never been in this room
before.

91
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:01,750
Well, I think it's time you start

92
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:03,630
Your tinker training.

93
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:07,510
Santa's sleigh.

94
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:10,070
You're gonna help me make it fly.

95
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:13,990
I thought the magical reindeer made
The sleighs fly.

96
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:16,670
And where do the reindeer get
their magic from?

97
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:20,990
Christmas spirit. Everybody
knows that.

98
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:23,030
Well, silly as it sounds,

99
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:24,950
A lot of people down south

100
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:26,830
Don't believe in Santa Claus.

101
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:28,550
What?!

102
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:31,670
Well, who do they think puts all?
their toys under the tree?

103
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:33,510
Well, there's a rumor floating around

104
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:35,350
That, uh, that the parents do it.

105
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:37,190
That's... that's ridiculous.

106
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:40,110
I mean, parents couldn't do that
all in one night.

107
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:41,190
What about Santa's cookies?

108
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:43,550
I suppose parents eat them, too?

109
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:44,550
Yeah, I, uh, I... I know,

110
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:46,950
Uh, and every earless and less
People

111
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:47,590
Believe in Santa Claus.

112
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:50,950
I mean, we have a real energy
crisis on our hands.

113
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:51,390
Oh.

114
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:55,190
I mean, just see how low the, uh
Claus meter is.

115
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:56,910
That's shocking.

116
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:58,590
That's why I came up

117
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:00,910
With this little beauty in the '60s.

118
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:06,510
WH-what is it?

119
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:07,950
It's a cringle 3000...

120
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:11,510
A 500-reindeer power jet turbine
engine.

121
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:12,950
Without it, the sleigh couldn't

122
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:16,750
Get more than, uh, a few feet off
the ground.

123
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:20,030
Well, it looks like we got

124
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:21,990
A short in the thermo coupler.

125
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:23,910
You wanna give mea hand with that?

126
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:25,350
You want me to help?

127
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:27,630
As much as, uh, buddy was accepted

128
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:29,710
By his family and friends,

129
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,750
There were a few drawbacks

130
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:35,390
To being, uh, a human in, uh
an elf's world.

131
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:57,630
Hey, Ming Ming.

132
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:58,550
Um...

133
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:02,790
I'm gonna be a little bit short
on today's quota.

134
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:03,750
It's all right, buddy.

135
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:05,270
Just how many etch-a-sketches

136
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:08,430
Did you get finished?

137
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:11,510
Come on, buddy. How many?

138
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:15,630
I made, uh... 85.

139
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:22,910
Eighty-five?

140
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:25,350
That puts you...

141
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:27,190
915 off the pace.

142
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:28,710
Ooh... that's bad.

143
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,030
Why don't you just say it?

144
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:32,510
I'm the worst toy maker in
the world.

145
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:34,910
I'm a cotton-headed ninny-muggins.

146
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:38,190
No, buddy, you're not cotton-
headed ninny-muggins.

147
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:41,190
We all just have different talents
That's all.

148
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:42,030
Seems like everyone else

149
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:43,470
Have the same talents
except for me.

150
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:46,190
You... you have, you have lots of
Talents, uh...

151
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:49,550
Special talents in fact, like
Um, uh...

152
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:50,310
Special talents?

153
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:52,910
You changed the batteries in the
smoke detector.

154
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:53,670
You sure did... aaa's.

155
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:56,750
And in six months, you'll have
to check 'em again...

156
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:57,470
Won't he?

157
00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:00,110
And you're the only baritone in
the elf choir.

158
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:02,230
You bring us down whole octave.

159
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:03,510
In a good way.

160
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:04,750
See, buddy?

161
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,830
You're not a cotton-headed ninny-
muggings.

162
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:10,510
You're just... special.

163
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:16,270
And so, buddy was sent where the...
The special elves work.

164
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:18,310
Aah!

165
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:31,670
Ah!

166
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:52,670
Hey, foom foom...

167
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:54,910
I hate to do this to you, but you
Think you could

168
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:57,110
Help me pick up the slack on those
etch-a-sketches?

169
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:59,150
No problem. I appreciate it.

170
00:10:59,190 --> 00:10:59,790
Buddy is killing me.

171
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:03,270
I already got lum lum and choochoo pulling' doubles.

172
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:04,750
That was quick thinking yesterday

173
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:06,150
With that ¡°special talents¡± thing.

174
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:07,430
I feel bad for the guy.

175
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:08,630
I just hope he doesn't get wise.

176
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:12,110
Well, if he hasn't figured out
He's a human by now,

177
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:14,390
I don't think he ever will.

178
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:20,430
If he hasn't figured
Out he's a human

179
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:22,990
By now, I don't think he ever will.

180
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:26,750
I think they're too small.

181
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:32,470
You're just... special.

182
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:51,430
You don't look so good, buddy.

183
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:51,910
Are you okay?

184
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:55,310
I'll be okay, I just need a glass
of water.

185
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:57,390
Aah!

186
00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:00,310
Buddy...

187
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:03,470
Unh! Aah!

188
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:21,950
Buddy, are you okay?

189
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:23,830
I'm sorry, papa.

190
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:26,190
I just need some alone time.

191
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:28,670
Buddy, I... I think we... we have
to talk.

192
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:31,710
Buddy, uh, I think there's something

193
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:34,670
I... I probably should tell you.

194
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:38,030
You probably should have found
out a long...

195
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:39,150
A long time ago.

196
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:42,110
I then proceeded to tell buddy of
how his father

197
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:44,910
Had fallen in love when he was
very young

198
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:47,710
With a beautiful girl named
Susan wells,

199
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:48,790
And how buddy was born

200
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:51,230
And put up for adoption by
his mother,

201
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:54,070
And how she had later passed away.

202
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:55,030
I... I told him his father

203
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:57,470
Had never even known that
Buddy was born,

204
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:58,190
And most importantly,

205
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:00,030
I told him where his father was...

206
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:03,990
Uh, in a magical land called
new York City.

207
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:06,270
My dad works there?

208
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:08,470
Empire state building.

209
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:14,830
Hey, buddy, wanna pick some
snow berries?

210
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:17,590
Not now, arctic puffin.

211
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:21,150
Hello, buddy. Oh... hi, Leon.

212
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:23,950
Why the long face, partner?

213
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:26,150
It seems I'm... I'm not an elf.

214
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:28,710
'Course you're not. You're 6'3"

215
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:31,230
And had a beard since you were 15.

216
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:32,270
Papa says my real father

217
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:35,350
Lives in a magical place far away.

218
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:36,350
I don't know what to do.

219
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:37,310
At least you have a daddy.

220
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:41,390
I was just rolled up one day and
left out here in the cold.

221
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:43,990
But the thing is, I've never even left
the North Pole.

222
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:46,270
Buddy, I've been around the world
Many times

223
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:48,510
When I was a young cumulus
nimbus cloud.

224
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:52,230
It's a wonderful place, filled with
Wondrous creatures...

225
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:52,710
Except dogs.

226
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:55,510
Oh, by the way, don't eat the
yellow snow.

227
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:56,070
Oh, I know that.

228
00:13:56,110 --> 00:14:00,030
All I'm say in' is, this might be
The golden opportunity

229
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:02,710
To find out whom you really are.

230
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:07,630
So, I hear you're going

231
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:10,470
On a little journey to
the big city.

232
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:11,590
Yup. Ahh.

233
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:12,830
I'm kind a nervous.

234
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:15,310
Leon says New York is pretty
different.

235
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:16,310
Oh, don't pay attention to Leon.

236
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:20,150
He's never been anywhere.
He doesn't have any feet.

237
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:22,670
I've been to New York thousands
of times.

238
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:23,670
Really? Mm-hmm.

239
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:24,550
What's it like?

240
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:27,310
Well, there are some things you
should know.

241
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:29,830
First off, you see gum on
The street,

242
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:32,270
Leave it there. It's not
free candy.

243
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:33,430
Oh. Second,

244
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:35,910
There are, like, 30 ray's
pizzas.

245
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:38,350
They all claim to be the
Original,

246
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:39,910
But the real one' son 11th.

247
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:42,470
And if you see a sign that
Says "peep show,"

248
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:44,950
That doesn't mean that
They're letting you

249
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:48,070
Look at presents before Christmas.

250
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:48,870
Can't wait to see my dad...

251
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:52,230
We're gonna go ices skating and...
And eat sugar plums.

252
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:54,430
Yeah, that's the other thing

253
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:57,390
I wanted to talk to you about.

254
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:59,910
You know, buddy...

255
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:02,350
Your father...

256
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:05,670
Well... he's on the naughty list.

257
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:08,990
No!

258
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:13,910
You're taking the books back?

259
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:17,110
See, I... I see what you're trying
to do here.

260
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,910
Y- You're trying to make me feel bad,

261
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:20,630
When, in actuality, you're the one

262
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:21,630
That missed the payments.

263
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:25,430
But the children love the books.

264
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:26,230
I know that, uh...

265
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:28,430
You know, I'm the one that ran
The focus groups,

266
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:29,830
But I like hearing that.

267
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:33,110
Listen, some people, they just
Lose sight

268
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:34,830
Of what's important in life.

269
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:40,430
That doesn't mean they can't find
their way again, huh?

270
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:41,230
Maybe all they need

271
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:43,790
Is just a little Christmas spirit.

272
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:49,070
Well, uh, I... I'm good at that.

273
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:51,470
I know you are.

274
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:04,630
And I'll...

275
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:05,350
I'll always, uh,

276
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:08,270
I'll always be here for you.

277
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:16,790
Now, uh...

278
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:19,110
Go... uh, get.

279
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:30,350
Bye, guys.

280
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:33,510
Bye, buddy. Bye, buddy. Take care.

281
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:35,430
Bye-bye.

282
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:38,510
Bye-bye.

283
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:39,750
Bye-bye, buddy.

284
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,270
There, there.

285
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:47,310
Huh?

286
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:49,110
Oh! Ohh!

287
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:54,790
Bye, buddy. Hope you find your dad.

288
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:56,710
Thanks, Mr. Narwhal.

289
00:16:57,470 --> 00:16:58,870
Bye.

290
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:49,790
Hey! What's your name?

291
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:52,430
My name's buddy.

292
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:56,790
Ohh!

293
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:01,110
Does someone need a hug?

294
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:07,550
aah, aah! That's not cool!

295
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:10,630
I just wanted a hug!

296
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:51,430
Hi.

297
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:52,950
Hello.

298
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:00,950
Thank you.

299
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:02,750
Thank you.

300
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:11,870
You did it! Congratulations!

301
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:16,670
"World's best cup of coffee.
"Great job, everybody.

302
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:19,270
It's great to meet you.

303
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:20,790
Hi.

304
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:34,230
Santa, san... uh, nope.

305
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:35,870
Not Santa.

306
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:37,430
Thank you.

307
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:38,950
Thank you.

308
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:26,310
Thank you. Hey, you know what?
No.

309
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:27,670
No, all right? Thank you.

310
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:30,110
Get outta here, get outta here.

311
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:05,550
Hello. Hi.

312
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:07,630
Ooh...

313
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:13,350
Beautiful.

314
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:25,590
Looks like a Christmas tree.

315
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:28,790
A reprint?

316
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:30,630
You know how much that's gonna
cost?

317
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:31,750
Two whole pages are missing.

318
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:32,950
The story doesn't make any sense.

319
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:35,150
What, you think some kid's gonna
notice two pages?

320
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:37,310
I mean, they... all they do is look
at pictures.

321
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:41,430
Sorry I can't ride with you the
Rest of the way up,

322
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:44,030
But this is where my dad works.
Well, have a good...

323
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:45,190
Oh, I forgot to give you a hug!

324
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:47,110
Oh, I don't know, Connie,
I've never

325
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:48,510
Declared kittens before.

326
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:49,430
How many?

327
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:50,910
Eight?

328
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:52,750
Uh, I don't know if I'm gonna
Have time.

329
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:55,150
Oh, all right, just bring 'em by
The camper this week,

330
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:57,510
And I'll see what I can do. I'm
Not gonna charge you.

331
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:59,910
Just bring 'em by, and I'll see
What I can do.

332
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:01,550
I have to go. Excuse me.

333
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:04,830
I'm here to see a Walter hobs.

334
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:06,230
I'm buddy the elf. Laughs

335
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:09,710
You look hilarious! Who sent you?

336
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:11,590
Papa elf. Papa elf?

337
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:13,270
Mm-hmm. From the North Pole.

338
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:14,870
From the North Pole? Yes.

339
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:17,510
So, you really think we should
Ship 'em?

340
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:19,790
No, I think we should take a
$30,000 bath

341
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:22,030
So some kid can understand
What happened?

342
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:23,630
To a puppy and a frigging pigeon

343
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:25,470
ship 'em.

344
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:27,230
Yeah.

345
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:29,870
Mr. Hobbs? It's me on the intercom.

346
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:30,270
Go ahead.

347
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:33,750
Yeah, I think some one sent you a
Christmas-gram.

348
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:36,350
Dad!

349
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:41,990
All right, uh, let's get it
Over with.

350
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:44,670
I walked all day and night to
Find you.

351
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:47,510
Uh, you look like you came from
the North Pole.

352
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:50,070
That's exactly where I came from.

353
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:51,710
Santa must've called you!

354
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:53,230
Oh, yeah, sure, he, uh...

355
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:55,110
Just got off the cell phone
with me.

356
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:56,310
You did?!

357
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:58,670
So, go on. Go on with what?

358
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,870
Well, are... are you gonna sing a
Song or something,

359
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:02,550
Or can I just go back to work?

360
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:05,310
A song? Uh...

361
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:10,510
Yeah. Anything for you, dad, uh...

362
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:15,710
I... I'm, I'm here with my dad

363
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:16,430
And we never met

364
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:20,150
And he wants me to sing
Him a song

365
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:21,590
And, um, I was adopted

366
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:23,870
But you didn't know I was born

367
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:28,190
So, I'm here now, I found you,
Daddy

368
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:30,390
And, guess what? I love you

369
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:34,030
I love you I love you!

370
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:37,110
Wow, that was weird.

371
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:39,870
You know, usually you guys just
Uh, you know,

372
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:42,590
Put my name into jingle bells or
something.

373
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:43,350
It's me, your son.

374
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:46,470
Susan wells had me, and... And she
Didn't tell you,

375
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:48,870
And, and, and, but now I'm here...

376
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:50,070
It's me buddy.

377
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:51,190
Susan wells.

378
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:54,390
Uh, you said Susan wells? Yes.

379
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:56,590
Who sent this Christmas-gram?

380
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:58,670
What's a Christmas-gram?
I want one.

381
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:05,670
It's okay, Walter's my father.

382
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:08,030
Well, your dad's busy right now.

383
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:09,230
Okay, I'll come back later.

384
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:10,670
Yeah, you know, you're not gonna

385
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:11,670
Come back for awhile, okay?

386
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:13,590
You're gonna go back to
Santa land.

387
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:14,070
Okay.

388
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:17,230
Yeah, why don't you go back?

389
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:37,110
Sorry! Sorry.

390
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:51,190
Passion fruit spray?

391
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:53,430
Fruit spray? Sure.

392
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:11,070
Sorry.

393
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:15,030
Sorry.

394
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:21,110
Do you wanna go?

395
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:37,350
Hey! Have you seen these?
toilets?

396
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:39,950
They're gl-normous!

397
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:43,670
"For that special someone."

398
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:48,070
Past!

399
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:49,390
Grunts

400
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:51,870
Hey, come... come here!

00:25:56,990 --> 00:25:59,190
What are you doing down here?

403
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:01,870
You're not supposed to be
Down here!

404
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:03,030
You can shop on your break,

405
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:04,830
You don't... come on, get upstairs!

406
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:07,550
Okay, I didn't know. Well
You should know!

407
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:08,510
Are you mad at me? No.

408
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:10,110
Are you sure? Yes, I'm sure.

409
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:11,390
Just do your job.

410
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:12,670
Okay, fair enough.

411
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:14,830
wow!

412
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:15,910
What's this?

413
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:17,590
This is the North Pole.

414
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:19,150
No, it's not. Yes, it is.

415
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:20,630
No, it's not. Yes, it is.

416
00:26:20,670 --> 00:26:22,150
No, it isn't. Yes, it is.

417
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:23,590
No, it isn't. Yes, it is.

418
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:26,430
No, it's not. Where's the snow?

419
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:27,870
Why you smiling like that?

420
00:26:27,910 --> 00:26:30,310
I just like to smile, smiling's
my favorite.

421
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:32,990
Make work your favorite, that's
You're favorite, okay?

00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:34,790
Okay. Work is your new favorite.

00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:35,390
Fine.

424
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:37,110
It's time for the announcement.

425
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:37,510
Okay.

426
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:40,510
Okay, people, tomorrow

00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:41,950
Santa's coming' to town!

428
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:43,350

429
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:44,750
Oh, my god!

430
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:49,030
Santa here?! I know him.

431
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:49,790
I know him.

432
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:51,270
He'll be hereto take pictures

433
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:52,710
With all the children.

434
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:53,150
Yeah!

435
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:55,710
Just keep your receipts.
10 a.m. Tomorrow.

436
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:56,630
10 a.m. Tomorrow.

437
00:26:56,670 --> 00:26:57,710
Santa's coming to town.

438
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:59,710
Yes. Can you sign this for me?

439
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:02,310
Ohh! Hi.

440
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:24,190
Are you enjoying the view?

441
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:27,350
You are very good at decorating
that tree.

442
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:29,270
Why are you messing with me?

443
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:31,190
Did krumpet put you up to this?

444
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:32,550
I'm not messing with you.

445
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:34,470
It's just nice to meet
Another human

446
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:36,910
Who shares my affinity for?
elf culture.

447
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:39,270
I'm just trying to get
through the holidays.

448
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:39,710
Get through?

449
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:43,110
Christmas is the greatest
Day in the whole wide world!

450
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:44,590
Please stop talking to me.

451
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:45,990
Uh-oh. Sounds like someone

452
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:48,070
Needs to sing a Christmas
Carol.

453
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:48,590
Go away.

454
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:50,310
The best way to
Spread Christmas cheer

455
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:51,910
Is singing loud for all to hear.

456
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:52,990
Thanks, but I don't sing.

457
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:55,390
Oh, it's easy, it's just like
Talking...

458
00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:56,270
Except louder and longer

459
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:57,470
And you move your voice up
And down.

460
00:27:57,510 --> 00:28:00,110
I can sing, but I just choose not
to sing.

461
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:02,230
Especially in front of other
people.

462
00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:04,230
Well, if you sing alone,
You can sing

463
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:05,830
In front of other people. There's
no difference.

464
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:08,310
Actually, there's a big difference.

465
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:10,190
No, there... no, there isn't.

466
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:11,590
Wait.

467
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:13,310
I'm singing

468
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:16,550
I'm in a store, and I'm singing

469
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:19,750
I'm in a store, and I'm singing

470
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:23,070
Hey! There's no singing in the
North Pole.

471
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:24,350
Yes, there is.

472
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:25,550
No, there's not.

473
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:27,910
We sing all the time.
No, there's not.

474
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:30,430
Especially when we make toys.

475
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:31,110
See?

476
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:33,350
Attention,
all gimbel's shoppers,

477
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:35,710
Please make your final purchases.

478
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:38,470
We'll be closing in ten minutes.

479
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:41,150
Well, it's time for me to go home.

480
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:44,710
But... but Santa's coming,
There's so much to do.

481
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:47,870
Yeah, um... laughs

482
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:50,350
I'll see you tomorrow...

483
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:53,390
Buddy. Jovie.

484
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:55,430
Hi. Hi.

485
00:28:57,990 --> 00:28:59,190
Jovie.

486
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:54,150
Hey, uh... I'm gonna eat in the
bedroom, okay?

487
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:55,190
I, uh, I got

488
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:56,830
A bunch of stuff to go over.

489
00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:59,110
Are you sure? I'm... I'm just way
Behind

490
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:00,870
On a bunch of stuff.

491
00:30:00,910 --> 00:30:02,150
Okay.

492
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:07,110
Can I eat in my room?

493
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:08,550
No. Why not?

494
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:09,550
Dad's eating in his room.

495
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:11,870
I got a bunch
Of homework to go over,

496
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:14,150
And I'm way behind on a bunch
of stuff.

497
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:16,550
You're eating here.

498
00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:51,790
I really can't stay

499
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:55,230
I've got to go 'way

500
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:58,670
This evening has been

501
00:30:58,710 --> 00:31:01,990
So very nice

502
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:05,870
My mother will start to worry

503
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:10,270
And father will be pacing'
The floor

504
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:14,390
So, really, I'd better scurry

505
00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:19,070
Well, may be just a half a drink
More

506
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:23,470
The neighbors might think
Baby, it's bad out there

507
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:25,870
Say, what's in this drink?

508
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:28,230
No cabs to be had out there

509
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:33,270
I wish I knew how to break the
Spell

510
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:37,350
I'll take your hat, your hair
Looks swell

511
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:39,750
I ought to say no, no, no, sir

512
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:41,670
Mind if I move in closer?

513
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:43,990
At least I'm gonna say that
I tried

514
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:46,270
What's the sense of hurting?
my pride?

515
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:48,990
I really can't stay

516
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:56,110
Ah, but it's cold outside baby,
it's cold outside!

517
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:04,270
Get out! Don't look at me!

518
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:05,670
Get out!

519
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:20,590
Just hear those sleigh bells
Jingling

520
00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:23,910
Ring-ting-tingling, too

521
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:26,110
Come on, it's lovely weather

522
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:29,990
For a sleigh ride together
With you

523
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:32,270
Outside the snow is falling

524
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:34,510
And friends are calling yoo-hoo

525
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:35,390
Dad?

526
00:32:35,390 --> 00:32:37,470
Come on, its lovely weather dad.

527
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:40,790
Dad, hi! It's me! For a sleigh
Ride together with you

00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:42,550
Buddy. Dad! Dad! Dad!

00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:45,910
Giddy-yap, giddy-yap, giddy-yap

530
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:49,230
Let's go, let's look at the show

531
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:53,990
We're riding in a wonderland
Of snow

532
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:54,950
Hey! It's okay,

533
00:32:54,990 --> 00:32:56,550
I just have a gift for my dad.

534
00:32:56,590 --> 00:32:57,390
Okay, I'll take this.

535
00:32:57,430 --> 00:32:58,950
Okay. Well, just make sure he knows

536
00:32:58,990 --> 00:33:00,350
It's from me buddy, his son, okay?

537
00:33:00,390 --> 00:33:01,630
Okay. And that I love him so much,

538
00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:04,110
And that I think he's the greatest
dad in the world.

539
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:05,310
You guys are so strong.

540
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:07,710
Wow! My cheeks are nice
And rosy

541
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:10,910
This is neat. And comfy
Cozy are we

542
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:13,950
We're snuggled up together

543
00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:17,790
Like two birds of a feather
Would be

544
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:20,550
Let's take that road before us

545
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:23,310
And sing a chorus or two

546
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:25,990
Come on, it's lovely weather

547
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:30,750
For a sleigh ride together
With you

548
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:39,830
Hey, you. Me?

549
00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:43,550
Come here. I wanna talk to you.

550
00:33:44,870 --> 00:33:46,630
What do you wanna talk to?
Me about?

551
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:47,270
How come you were

552
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:49,750
In the women's locker room these
morning?

553
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:50,430
I heard you singing.

554
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:52,750
You sure it had nothing to
Do with the fact

555
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:54,350
That I was naked in the shower?

556
00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:56,470
I didn't know you were naked.

557
00:33:56,510 --> 00:33:58,030
Why were you here so early?

558
00:33:58,070 --> 00:33:59,550
They shut my water off.

559
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:02,310
What were you doing here so
early?

560
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:04,550
Building this.

561
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:07,710
You built this? Mm-hmm.

562
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:10,310
They're kind a pissed about
this.

563
00:34:10,350 --> 00:34:11,590
Really?

564
00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:13,670
Hey, guys.

565
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:14,670
Have you seen the place?
Mm-hmm.

566
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:16,710
It's pretty good. It's a
little too good.

567
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:18,710
Corporate must have sent in a
professional.

568
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:21,510
I don't know why some body's
Gunning' for my job,

569
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:24,990
But, look... let's
Remain team, okay?

570
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:26,870
'Cause if I go, we all go.

571
00:34:26,910 --> 00:34:28,710
If you get wind of anything,

572
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:31,230
Call me on my radio,
Channel three.

573
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:34,150
Code word is "Santa's got
A brand new bag,"

574
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:35,430
Okay?

575
00:34:35,910 --> 00:34:38,830
Six-inch ribbon curis, honey.

576
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:41,710
That's impossible. Six... inches.

577
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:46,830
By the way... I think you have

578
00:34:46,870 --> 00:34:48,550
The most beautiful singing voice

579
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:50,430
In the whole wide world.

580
00:34:57,710 --> 00:34:59,270
Santa...

581
00:34:59,310 --> 00:35:01,710
Hey, hey! Ho ho ho!

582
00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:04,230
Yeah!

583
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:06,990
Santa, it's me buddy!

584
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:09,910
It's me! Hey, buddy,
How you doing?

585
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:10,830
It's me!

586
00:35:10,870 --> 00:35:12,430
Are you ready to see Santa?

587
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:13,790
Who the heck are you?

588
00:35:13,830 --> 00:35:16,270
What are you talking about?
I'm Santa Claus.

589
00:35:16,270 --> 00:35:17,070
No, you're not.

590
00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:20,110
Uh, WH-why, of course I am!

591
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:21,070
Ho ho ho ho ho!

592
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:22,830
Well, if you're Santa...

593
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:25,910
What song did I sing for you on?
Your birthday this year?

594
00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:29,390
Uh, happy birthday of course!

595
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:30,470
Ho ho ho ho ho!

596
00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:33,390
Uh, so, how old are you, son?

597
00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:33,910
Four.

598
00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:35,270
You're a big boy, what's
your name?

599
00:35:35,310 --> 00:35:37,750
Paul. And, uh, what can I
get you for Christmas?

600
00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:38,950
Paul... don't tell him what
You want.

601
00:35:38,990 --> 00:35:41,230
He's a liar. Let the kid talk.

602
00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:44,430
You disgust me. How can you live?
With yourself?

603
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:46,510
Just cool it, zippy. Woman:
Smile.

604
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:48,230
You sit on a throne of lies.

605
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:50,350
Look, I'm not kidding'.
You're a fake.

606
00:35:50,350 --> 00:35:51,270
I'm a fake? Yes.

607
00:35:51,310 --> 00:35:53,550
How'd you like to be dead, huh?

608
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:56,430
Fake. No, he's kidding.

609
00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:56,910
You stink.

610
00:35:56,910 --> 00:35:59,150
I think you're gonna have a good
Christmas, all right?

611
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:00,830
You smell like beef and cheese.

612
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:02,430
You don't smell like Santa.

613
00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:03,630
Okay.

614
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:07,990
He's an imposter! He's not
Santa!

615
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:12,750
He's a fake! He's a fake!
Come here. Come here!

616
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:14,190
I saw!

617
00:36:15,950 --> 00:36:17,590
He's a fake!

618
00:36:22,990 --> 00:36:26,270
Ha ha! Where you going now?
Where you going...?

619
00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:31,310
Ohh! Ohh!

620
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:35,950
No!

621
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:42,070
He's not Santa Claus!

622
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:43,790
He's not Santa!

623
00:36:45,910 --> 00:36:47,590
"To someone special."

624
00:37:13,270 --> 00:37:15,350
What's that? Intercom.

625
00:37:15,350 --> 00:37:17,350
All right.

626
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:23,790
Yeah? Mr. Hobbs, the police are
On line one.

627
00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:26,470
Police. Hello?

628
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:44,870
Dad!

629
00:37:44,910 --> 00:37:47,030
I knew that you'd come,
I love you for coming.

630
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:48,550
Officer tom, this is my dad.

631
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:50,030
This is Walter... he came.

632
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:50,790
He bailed me out.

633
00:37:50,830 --> 00:37:51,990
They gave me one phone call.

634
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:53,110
They gave me one phone call,

635
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:55,510
And I said," I know who
I'm gonna call...

636
00:37:55,550 --> 00:37:56,150
Walter Hobbs."

637
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:57,110
And sure enough, you showed up.

638
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:59,070
You did, they said you weren't
goanna show up.

639
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:01,630
They told me so many times...
shh shh shh shh shh.

640
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:04,150
Just who the heck are you,
And what is your problem?

641
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:06,190
I- I'm buddy, I'm your son.

642
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:07,230
Wait, um...

643
00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:09,070
Tell me, tell me, tell me, uh...

644
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:10,830
Where'd you get this picture?

645
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:13,310
Papa elf gave it to me.

646
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:16,110
Listen... is this some kind a
game?

647
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:17,590
What do you want, some money?

648
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:19,030
No! I just wanted to meet you,

649
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:22,150
And I thought you might Anna
Meet me.

650
00:38:26,950 --> 00:38:29,110
Who wouldn't Anna meet you?

651
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:31,550
I thought maybe we could make
Gingerbread houses,

652
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:33,950
And eat cookie dough, and go
Ice skating, and...

653
00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:36,070
And maybe even hold hands.

654
00:38:36,110 --> 00:38:37,750
Uh-huh.

655
00:38:37,790 --> 00:38:39,790
Come with me. Okay.

656
00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:50,230
Okay. What have we got here?

657
00:38:58,430 --> 00:39:00,590
Buddy, don't eat those.

658
00:39:05,790 --> 00:39:06,750
Ohh!

659
00:39:06,790 --> 00:39:08,070
We got to really hurry up, Walter,

660
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:10,630
'cause I'm double booked the
rest of the afternoon.

661
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:11,110
Am I sick?

662
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:12,350
Yeah, but that's not why we're
Here.

663
00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:13,310
We're hereto do a test, come on.

664
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:14,310
What kind test? Just a test to
Find out

665
00:39:14,350 --> 00:39:16,390
If you're my son or not. Why am
I sitting on paper?

666
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:18,350
Because it's sanitary for the
other patients.

667
00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:20,230
Now, sit still so I can do
the finger prick.

668
00:39:20,270 --> 00:39:21,790
Finger prick!

669
00:39:21,830 --> 00:39:23,270
Ohh! It's cold.

670
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:24,310
Yeah, just pleases it still,
Please?

671
00:39:24,350 --> 00:39:25,310
Okay, can I listen to your
necklace?

672
00:39:25,310 --> 00:39:26,830
No, you can't. Will you
Just sit still...

673
00:39:26,870 --> 00:39:27,790
Why is there a skeleton?
over there?

674
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:28,950
I don't know, Walter,
Could you please...?

675
00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:30,070
If I squint it looks like a
pirate flag.

676
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:31,070
Could you please have him?
Sit still?

677
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:32,510
Does he have a name? No,
He hasn't got a name.

678
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:33,430
I'm sorry, Ben, I am sorry.

679
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:34,430
I have a lot of patients
waiting.

680
00:39:34,470 --> 00:39:35,990
Would you please it still?
Please.

681
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:37,470
He got mad at me. Yes, he did.
He did.

682
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:39,670
The sooner you sit still,
The sooner we can

683
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:40,350
Get this mess over with.

684
00:39:40,390 --> 00:39:41,790
Okay. Then can we eat sugar
plums?

685
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:43,150
You betch a... we'll eat sugar
Plums,

686
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:45,990
Have gingerbread houses,
And we'll even paint eggs.

687
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:48,310
Well, paint eggs, that's Easter.

688
00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:52,190
Ow! Ohh...

689
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:54,190
My finger has a heartbeat.

690
00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:56,910
It won't hurt so much after
a little.

691
00:39:56,950 --> 00:39:58,630
What's your name?

692
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:00,230
Buddy.

693
00:40:00,270 --> 00:40:01,790
I'm Carolyn.

694
00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:03,190
Hi.

695
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:05,270
What do you want for Christmas?

696
00:40:05,310 --> 00:40:06,310
A Suzy-talks-a-lot.

697
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:08,950
I'll put in a good word with
the big man.

698
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:10,790
Thanks. Your costume is pretty.

699
00:40:10,830 --> 00:40:13,990
Oh, it's not a costume.
I'm an elf.

700
00:40:14,030 --> 00:40:15,830
Well, technically, I'm a human,

701
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:17,230
But I was raised by elves.

702
00:40:17,270 --> 00:40:20,510
Oh, I'm a human raised by humans.

703
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:23,070
Hmm. Cool.

704
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:30,110
So?

705
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:34,670
It's a boy... buddy's your son.

706
00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:36,230
That's very impossible.

707
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:37,830
You... you saw that guy out there.

708
00:40:37,830 --> 00:40:39,270
He's... he's certifiably insane.

709
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:40,630
He's probably just reverting

710
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:43,150
To a state of childlike
dependency.

711
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:44,070
An elf?

712
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:46,070
What he needs is to be nurtured.

713
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,990
Oh, I see.

714
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:49,870
So, um, uh...

715
00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:51,510
You'd like me to breastfeed him?

716
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:53,110
Walter, just bring him home.

717
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:54,270
Introduce him to Emily and
Michael,

718
00:40:54,310 --> 00:40:56,390
And once... once he comes to
Terms with reality,

719
00:40:56,430 --> 00:40:59,430
He should drop the whole elf
Thing and move on with his life.

720
00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:01,830
I mean, that's what I would do if
I was you.

721
00:41:01,870 --> 00:41:05,270
Oh, my god! Walter, this is...

722
00:41:05,310 --> 00:41:06,510
This is wonderful,

723
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:08,350
You... you have another son.

724
00:41:08,350 --> 00:41:10,070
Wonderful. Oh, gosh, I...

725
00:41:10,110 --> 00:41:12,790
I guess I never really thought
of it that way.

726
00:41:12,830 --> 00:41:14,150
This is incredible, I...

727
00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:16,350
You know, it's a little
complicated,

728
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:18,510
But it's nothing that we can't
handle.

729
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:20,910
Honey? What?

730
00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:23,790
He thinks he's an elf.

731
00:41:23,830 --> 00:41:24,870
I'm sorry, what?

732
00:41:24,910 --> 00:41:27,470
He think she's a Christmas elf.

733
00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:28,110
Oh, come on, Walter,

734
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:32,190
I'm sure he doesn't actually
think he's an elf.

735
00:41:32,270 --> 00:41:35,470
And then, I traveled through
the seven levels

736
00:41:35,470 --> 00:41:36,910
Of the candy cane forest,

737
00:41:36,910 --> 00:41:40,910
Past the sea of swirly-twirly
gumdrops,

738
00:41:40,910 --> 00:41:46,350
And then, I walked through the
Lincoln tunnel.

739
00:42:03,150 --> 00:42:04,790
Ahh.

740
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:09,710
So, where were you for the
last 30 years?

741
00:42:09,750 --> 00:42:10,590
The north pole.

742
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:13,190
Can you pass the maple syrup?
Please?

743
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:16,910
I... I didn't put... it's
spaghetti.

744
00:42:16,950 --> 00:42:20,590
Oh, you know what? I think
I have some.

745
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:21,990
Yes.

746
00:42:22,830 --> 00:42:24,550
You like sugar, huh?

747
00:42:24,590 --> 00:42:26,270
Is there sugar in syrup?

748
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:27,390
Yes.

749
00:42:27,430 --> 00:42:28,590
Then yes.

750
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:31,030
We elves try to stick to the
four main food groups

751
00:42:31,070 --> 00:42:36,910
Candy, candy canes, candy corns,
and syrup.

752
00:42:36,950 --> 00:42:40,430
So, will you be staying with us?
Then?

753
00:42:40,470 --> 00:42:41,550
You mean I can stay?

754
00:42:41,590 --> 00:42:42,990
Of course you can. Emily.

755
00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:45,430
How... how long do you think
you'll be with us?

756
00:42:45,470 --> 00:42:47,830
I... I hadn't really planned
it out,

757
00:42:47,870 --> 00:42:50,190
But I was thinking, like...
forever.

758
00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:52,830
Emily? Can I just speak to you
for a minute

759
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:55,510
in the, uh, kitchen, please?

760
00:42:58,070 --> 00:43:00,150
Are you crazy? He cannot
stay here.

761
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:02,190
Clearly he has some serious issues.

762
00:43:02,230 --> 00:43:04,350
We can't just throw him out in
the snow.

763
00:43:04,390 --> 00:43:06,150
Why not? He loves the snow.

764
00:43:06,190 --> 00:43:08,110
He's told me 15 times.

765
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:10,030
Walter, he's your son.

766
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:24,950
Did you hear that?

767
00:43:26,230 --> 00:43:28,830
You are so weird.

768
00:43:30,670 --> 00:43:32,030
Dad?

769
00:43:34,870 --> 00:43:36,590
Dad?

770
00:43:37,430 --> 00:43:39,710
Dad!

771
00:43:40,350 --> 00:43:41,430
What?

772
00:43:45,270 --> 00:43:46,470
What?

773
00:43:50,550 --> 00:43:52,350
I am not gonna tuck you in.

774
00:43:52,390 --> 00:43:55,670
I... I promise I'll go right
to sleep.

775
00:43:57,750 --> 00:43:59,150
Fine.

776
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:08,390
Tickle fight, tickle fight!
buddy, stop.

777
00:44:08,390 --> 00:44:10,430
Tickle fight. Tickle... stop
stop, stop.

778
00:44:10,470 --> 00:44:11,950
Sorry.

779
00:44:12,790 --> 00:44:13,910
It's all right.

780
00:44:13,950 --> 00:44:14,830
Hey, uh...

781
00:44:15,430 --> 00:44:17,790
You just lay there and go to
sleep.

782
00:44:17,790 --> 00:44:19,030
Okay.

783
00:44:19,070 --> 00:44:20,270
Okay.

784
00:44:21,110 --> 00:44:23,910
Dad? Hmm?

785
00:44:23,950 --> 00:44:26,710
I love you.

786
00:44:29,150 --> 00:44:32,550
Okay. Go to sleep now.

787
00:44:36,830 --> 00:44:38,030
Well, this is really something.

788
00:44:38,070 --> 00:44:42,230
I'm usually the one making
breakfast.

789
00:44:43,190 --> 00:44:46,070
That's good, that's good.

790
00:44:47,390 --> 00:44:48,950
Okay.

791
00:44:55,790 --> 00:44:57,430
Oh, that's good.

792
00:44:57,470 --> 00:44:59,070
Good? Good.

793
00:44:59,110 --> 00:45:00,350
Good.

794
00:45:00,350 --> 00:45:03,190
So, did you, um...

795
00:45:03,230 --> 00:45:04,750
Did you sleep okay last night?

796
00:45:04,790 --> 00:45:06,270
Great. I got a full 40 minutes.

797
00:45:06,270 --> 00:45:09,470
And I had time to build that
rocking horse.

798
00:45:09,590 --> 00:45:13,470
Uh, oh, my gosh. You actually
made that?

799
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:16,190
Where did you get all the wood?

800
00:45:25,510 --> 00:45:28,270
Good morning, honey. Good
morning, dad.

801
00:45:28,310 --> 00:45:31,070
Walter, buddy has made us
breakfast.

802
00:45:31,070 --> 00:45:32,950
Isn't that nice?

803
00:45:32,990 --> 00:45:34,670
And lunch.

804
00:45:34,710 --> 00:45:36,070
And lunch.

805
00:45:36,110 --> 00:45:37,350
Bye.

806
00:45:37,390 --> 00:45:38,270
So, dad, how many scoops?

807
00:45:38,310 --> 00:45:41,150
I'll stick with the coffee now,
thanks.

808
00:45:43,270 --> 00:45:44,070
So, dad...

809
00:45:44,110 --> 00:45:45,710
I planned out our whole day.

810
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:46,870
First, we'll make snow angels
for two hours,

811
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:49,430
And then we'll go ice skating
and then we'll eat a
whole roll

812
00:45:49,470 --> 00:45:51,430
Of tollhouse cookie dough as fast
as we can,

813
00:45:51,430 --> 00:45:53,630
And then, to finish, we'll snuggle.

814
00:45:53,670 --> 00:45:56,230
I've got to go to work, buddy.

815
00:45:56,270 --> 00:45:57,390
Oh, and another thing...

816
00:45:57,430 --> 00:45:59,150
If you're going to be staying
here,

817
00:45:59,190 --> 00:46:00,870
You should think about, you know,

818
00:46:00,910 --> 00:46:02,470
Getting rid of the costume.

819
00:46:02,510 --> 00:46:03,790
But I've worn this my whole life.

820
00:46:03,830 --> 00:46:06,830
You're not in the North Pole any
longer.

821
00:46:06,870 --> 00:46:09,030
You wanna make me happy, don't you?

822
00:46:09,070 --> 00:46:09,630
More than anything.

823
00:46:09,670 --> 00:46:14,310
Then, lose the tights. I mean,
as soon as possible.

824
00:46:14,310 --> 00:46:15,870
As soon as possible?

825
00:46:15,910 --> 00:46:17,390
As soon as possible.

826
00:46:17,430 --> 00:46:18,750
Okay.

827
00:46:20,470 --> 00:46:21,630
I almost forgot...

828
00:46:21,670 --> 00:46:23,430
Aah! Aah!

829
00:46:26,270 --> 00:46:27,870
Good morning.

830
00:46:32,190 --> 00:46:32,710
Walter here.

831
00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:34,950
It worked, it's you.

832
00:46:34,950 --> 00:46:36,870
How'd you get this number?

833
00:46:36,910 --> 00:46:38,790
Emily left an emergency list.

834
00:46:38,790 --> 00:46:39,350
I see.

835
00:46:39,390 --> 00:46:40,950
And, uh, is this an emergency?

836
00:46:40,990 --> 00:46:42,070
There's a horrible noise

837
00:46:42,110 --> 00:46:44,990
Coming from the evil
box underneath the window.

838
00:46:45,030 --> 00:46:46,230
It sounds like this...

839
00:46:49,750 --> 00:46:52,470
It's, uh, it's... it's not evil,
buddy,

840
00:46:52,510 --> 00:46:53,550
It's, uh, it's a radiator,

841
00:46:53,590 --> 00:46:55,350
And the heat makes noise when
it comes on.

842
00:46:55,390 --> 00:46:58,430
No, it doesn't. It... It's very
evil.

843
00:46:58,470 --> 00:47:01,910
It's scary to look at. It's...
okay...

844
00:47:01,950 --> 00:47:05,390
I'm going toward... oh, wait.
Yes, it is.

845
00:47:05,430 --> 00:47:07,030
Okay, it's okay. It's okay.

846
00:47:07,070 --> 00:47:07,910
Everything's fine.

847
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:08,710
You were right.

848
00:47:08,750 --> 00:47:11,150
Okay, good, uh, I'm gonna hang
up now.

849
00:47:11,190 --> 00:47:11,950
I love you.

850
00:47:11,990 --> 00:47:13,590
I'll call you in five minutes.

851
00:47:13,630 --> 00:47:15,190
No, no, buddy, don't, uh...

852
00:47:15,230 --> 00:47:17,670
You... you don't have to call me,
okay?

853
00:47:17,710 --> 00:47:19,150
Good idea, you call me.

854
00:47:19,190 --> 00:47:20,910
Okay. I'm gonna hang up now.

855
00:47:20,950 --> 00:47:22,710
I painted a picture of a
butterfly.

856
00:47:22,750 --> 00:47:24,910
Good. I'm gonna hang up now.

857
00:47:24,950 --> 00:47:27,070
I tuned the piano.

858
00:47:27,110 --> 00:47:29,190
Okay, I love you. Bye.

859
00:47:29,230 --> 00:47:31,110
Mmm...

860
00:47:31,150 --> 00:47:32,670
Mmm... Mmm.

861
00:47:46,550 --> 00:47:48,510
Mmm.

862
00:47:49,430 --> 00:47:52,150
Hobbs. Hey!

863
00:47:52,430 --> 00:47:53,790
How you doing? Please, sit
down.

864
00:47:53,830 --> 00:47:56,030
I haven't seen you since
the retreat.

865
00:47:56,070 --> 00:47:56,910
You're looking good.

866
00:47:56,950 --> 00:47:58,310
Oh, thank you very much.
You as well.

867
00:47:58,350 --> 00:47:59,630
To what do I owe the, uh,
pleasure?

868
00:47:59,670 --> 00:48:02,950
Well, to be honest, I got a call
from my niece.

869
00:48:03,910 --> 00:48:04,670
She wants to know

870
00:48:04,710 --> 00:48:08,310
How a certain puppy and a
certain pigeon

871
00:48:08,350 --> 00:48:11,910
Escape the clutches of a
certain evil witch.

872
00:48:13,310 --> 00:48:13,870
Believe me, uh,

873
00:48:13,910 --> 00:48:15,350
We're already looking for new
printers.

874
00:48:15,390 --> 00:48:17,830
This one has obviously gotten a
little sloppy.

875
00:48:17,870 --> 00:48:20,270
Maybe it isn't the printer who's
gotten sloppy.

876
00:48:20,310 --> 00:48:22,390
That's your signature, right?

877
00:48:22,430 --> 00:48:25,310
You know, we could sit here and
point fingers all day.

878
00:48:25,350 --> 00:48:26,750
I've got news for you...

879
00:48:26,790 --> 00:48:29,230
Even if those two pages were
in there,

880
00:48:29,230 --> 00:48:30,590
The book still would have sucked.

881
00:48:30,630 --> 00:48:32,830
Have you seen the numbers for
this quarter?

882
00:48:32,830 --> 00:48:34,990
Uh, they'll be here today. Oh,
they're in.

883
00:48:35,030 --> 00:48:36,830
That frigging puppy and pigeon

884
00:48:36,870 --> 00:48:38,030
Are tanking hard, Hobbs.

885
00:48:38,030 --> 00:48:39,950
My people estimate we're
gonna post

886
00:48:39,950 --> 00:48:41,630
A minus eight for this quarter.

887
00:48:41,670 --> 00:48:44,750
A minus eight! That does not
happen!

888
00:48:44,750 --> 00:48:47,150
You know, we'll... we'll bounce
back, we...

889
00:48:47,190 --> 00:48:48,830
No, no, no. No? Well...

890
00:48:48,870 --> 00:48:50,510
We're gonna ship a new book

891
00:48:50,550 --> 00:48:51,870
The first quarter.

892
00:48:51,910 --> 00:48:53,150
First quarter?

893
00:48:53,190 --> 00:48:55,710
I'm gonna be back in town on
the 24th.

894
00:48:55,710 --> 00:48:58,190
At that time, I would love
to hear

895
00:48:58,230 --> 00:48:59,910
In exact detail

896
00:48:59,950 --> 00:49:02,990
What your plans are for this
new book.

897
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:06,750
Uh, wait a minute, the, uh
the 24th, that's Christmas
eve.

898
00:49:08,510 --> 00:49:09,430
And?

899
00:49:09,470 --> 00:49:11,310
And, uh...

900
00:49:11,350 --> 00:49:14,270
No problem. Be great to have
you in the loop.

901
00:49:17,270 --> 00:49:20,150
All right, I got every
weapon in the game.

902
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:22,550
I got full health, I got full
armor.

903
00:49:22,590 --> 00:49:23,350
Michael!

904
00:49:23,390 --> 00:49:24,470
I got full...

905
00:49:24,510 --> 00:49:25,590
Michael!

906
00:49:25,590 --> 00:49:27,510
It's me buddy!

907
00:49:28,230 --> 00:49:28,910
You know that guy?

908
00:49:28,950 --> 00:49:31,790
No, I've never seen him before.

909
00:49:31,830 --> 00:49:34,630
It's me buddy! Your brother!

910
00:49:34,670 --> 00:49:35,950
Oh, man.

911
00:49:35,990 --> 00:49:40,390
No, Michael! Wait! It's your
brother bud...

912
00:49:41,270 --> 00:49:43,790
Sorry. Sorry! Horn honks

913
00:49:44,470 --> 00:49:47,030
Michael! Michael!

914
00:49:47,070 --> 00:49:48,790
Michael!

915
00:49:48,790 --> 00:49:51,030
Michael, wait up!

916
00:49:51,070 --> 00:49:52,590
Michael! Michael!

917
00:49:52,630 --> 00:49:54,070
Wow, you're fast.

918
00:49:54,070 --> 00:49:55,870
I'm gladi caught up with you.

919
00:49:55,910 --> 00:49:57,390
I waited five hours for you.

920
00:49:57,430 --> 00:49:58,870
Why is your coat so big?

921
00:49:58,910 --> 00:50:01,310
So, good news... I saw a dog
today.

922
00:50:01,350 --> 00:50:03,670
Have you seen a dog?
You probably have.

923
00:50:03,710 --> 00:50:05,310
How was school? Was it fun?

924
00:50:05,350 --> 00:50:07,190
Did you get a lot of
homework, huh?

925
00:50:07,190 --> 00:50:08,390
Do you have any friends?

926
00:50:08,430 --> 00:50:09,830
Do you have a best friend?

927
00:50:09,830 --> 00:50:11,190
Does he have a big coat, too?

928
00:50:11,230 --> 00:50:12,630
Go away!

929
00:50:13,910 --> 00:50:17,870
Ow! Son of a nutcracker!

930
00:50:20,630 --> 00:50:21,990
Run!

931
00:50:22,430 --> 00:50:25,750
Get him! Get the
green guy!

932
00:50:32,470 --> 00:50:35,110
Oh, no. These guys are bad news.

933
00:50:35,150 --> 00:50:37,590
We better get outta here.

934
00:50:38,870 --> 00:50:41,270
You know what? We can take 'em.

935
00:50:41,310 --> 00:50:45,110
Okay, just start making as
many snowballs as you can.

936
00:50:51,950 --> 00:50:54,230
You ready?

937
00:50:55,150 --> 00:50:57,830
Let's go. Aah! Ow.

938
00:50:58,990 --> 00:51:00,310
Ow!

939
00:51:04,990 --> 00:51:06,750
Run!

940
00:51:14,430 --> 00:51:17,150
Oh, man. One got away.

941
00:51:17,150 --> 00:51:18,390
Snowball.

942
00:51:26,430 --> 00:51:27,990
Unh!

943
00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:30,110
Wow.

944
00:51:30,750 --> 00:51:33,470
Where did you say you were from?

945
00:51:34,430 --> 00:51:35,590
Oh, yeah

946
00:51:35,630 --> 00:51:38,230
Candles burning low

947
00:51:38,270 --> 00:51:40,790
Lots of mistletoe

948
00:51:40,830 --> 00:51:46,390
Lots of snow and ice everywhere
we go

949
00:51:46,430 --> 00:51:51,710
Choirs singing carols right
outside my door

950
00:51:51,750 --> 00:51:53,630
All these things and more

951
00:51:53,670 --> 00:51:55,550
I wish dad were here.

952
00:51:55,550 --> 00:51:55,790
Why?

953
00:51:55,830 --> 00:51:59,590
'Cause he's the greatest dad in
the whole wide world.

954
00:51:59,630 --> 00:52:00,390
Are you kidding?

955
00:52:00,430 --> 00:52:02,910
He's the worst dad in the world.

956
00:52:02,950 --> 00:52:04,630
What do you mean?

957
00:52:04,670 --> 00:52:06,310
All he does is work.

958
00:52:06,350 --> 00:52:07,670
Working's fun.

959
00:52:07,710 --> 00:52:09,630
Not the way he does it.

960
00:52:09,630 --> 00:52:10,590
All he cares about is money.

961
00:52:10,630 --> 00:52:14,590
He doesn't care about you,
or me, or anybody.

962
00:52:14,630 --> 00:52:17,310
Well, he is on the naughty list.

963
00:52:21,750 --> 00:52:23,550
You like her?

964
00:52:23,550 --> 00:52:25,310
Like who?

965
00:52:25,470 --> 00:52:27,270
The girl you're staring at.

966
00:52:27,270 --> 00:52:28,950
Oh, uh...

967
00:52:28,990 --> 00:52:30,630
Yeah.

968
00:52:31,870 --> 00:52:33,950
Why don't you ask her out?

969
00:52:33,990 --> 00:52:34,870
Out?

970
00:52:34,910 --> 00:52:37,870
You know, on a date...
to eat food.

971
00:52:37,910 --> 00:52:38,710
Food?

972
00:52:38,750 --> 00:52:41,350
Yes, real food, not candy.

973
00:52:41,390 --> 00:52:43,950
And if she says yes,
you're in.

974
00:52:43,990 --> 00:52:46,470
It's like a secret code
girls have.

975
00:52:48,030 --> 00:52:49,950
Well, look who it is.

976
00:52:49,990 --> 00:52:52,950
Hi, Jovie. Hi.

977
00:52:54,830 --> 00:52:56,550
Oh, uh, this is Michael.

978
00:52:56,550 --> 00:52:58,110
I'm his brother.

979
00:52:59,030 --> 00:52:59,990
Hi.

980
00:53:00,030 --> 00:53:01,750
So, what are you doing here?

981
00:53:01,790 --> 00:53:04,270
Did gimbel's give you your
job back?

982
00:53:04,310 --> 00:53:06,750
No. But things worked out
pretty good.

983
00:53:06,790 --> 00:53:08,710
They gave mea restraining
order.

984
00:53:08,830 --> 00:53:12,630
Well, um, you should probably
get outta here.

985
00:53:12,670 --> 00:53:15,430
Ho ho ho!

986
00:53:15,430 --> 00:53:17,590
But... I really wanted to
see you,

987
00:53:17,630 --> 00:53:21,510
And... and I think you're
beautiful, and I, um...

988
00:53:21,550 --> 00:53:24,870
I feel really warm when I
am around you,

989
00:53:24,870 --> 00:53:28,990
And, um, my tongue swells up.

990
00:53:32,790 --> 00:53:34,950
So...

991
00:53:35,230 --> 00:53:37,310
Do you wanna go eat food?

992
00:53:37,990 --> 00:53:40,190
Do I... do I wanna eat food?

993
00:53:40,230 --> 00:53:41,110
Mm-hmm.

994
00:53:41,150 --> 00:53:46,230
You know, uh, the code... food.

995
00:53:47,910 --> 00:53:50,910
Well, I just had my lunch
break.

996
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:53,950
Oh, okay. I understand.

997
00:53:53,990 --> 00:53:56,670
But I'm free on Thursday.

998
00:53:57,630 --> 00:53:58,990
Thursday! Thursday!

999
00:53:59,030 --> 00:54:01,110
Come on. That'd be great.

1000
00:54:01,150 --> 00:54:02,030
All right.

1001
00:54:02,070 --> 00:54:03,750
Was that okay?

1002
00:54:03,790 --> 00:54:06,310
You did great, man.

1003
00:54:06,790 --> 00:54:08,110
What should we put on it
first?

1004
00:54:08,110 --> 00:54:09,430
Lights! Oh, good.

1005
00:54:09,470 --> 00:54:10,670
And then, after that?

1006
00:54:10,710 --> 00:54:13,470
Ornaments! Ornaments, okay.

1007
00:54:14,350 --> 00:54:15,830
What the hell's that?

1008
00:54:15,870 --> 00:54:17,070
A Christmas tree.

1009
00:54:17,110 --> 00:54:18,270
A Christmas tree?

1010
00:54:18,310 --> 00:54:21,310
Buddy chopped it down in
the park.

1011
00:54:22,030 --> 00:54:23,430
Emily.

1012
00:54:23,470 --> 00:54:25,950
I don't know what you're making
such a big deal about.

1013
00:54:25,990 --> 00:54:27,910
They were just having a
little fun.

1014
00:54:27,950 --> 00:54:29,790
Oh, fun? So felonies are
fun now?

1015
00:54:29,830 --> 00:54:32,510
I thought, see, felonies
were felonies.

1016
00:54:32,550 --> 00:54:33,430
Okay, the tree thing was bad.

1017
00:54:33,470 --> 00:54:34,670
I'll get him to plant
another one.

1018
00:54:34,710 --> 00:54:37,230
But at least Michael is
happy for once.

1019
00:54:37,230 --> 00:54:39,670
What, uh, what's that supposed
to mean?

1020
00:54:39,710 --> 00:54:41,910
Well, I don't think it's any
secret, Walter,

1021
00:54:41,950 --> 00:54:44,110
That you haven't exactly been
there for him.

1022
00:54:44,150 --> 00:54:46,030
I'll tell you what, why don't
we just

1023
00:54:46,030 --> 00:54:47,870
Pull him outta school and let
the, uh,

1024
00:54:47,910 --> 00:54:49,110
Deranged elf man raise him?

1025
00:54:49,150 --> 00:54:51,870
Then they can have lots of
fun committing felonies.

1026
00:54:51,910 --> 00:54:54,830
How are we gonna get the star
on top?

1027
00:54:54,830 --> 00:54:56,310
I got it.

1028
00:55:07,750 --> 00:55:08,790
I mean, what are we gonna do?

1029
00:55:08,830 --> 00:55:10,910
We can't... we can't leave him
alone here.

1030
00:55:10,950 --> 00:55:13,350
He's gonna destroy the place.

1031
00:55:15,310 --> 00:55:15,950
Why don't you, um...

1032
00:55:15,990 --> 00:55:17,230
Why don't you take off tomorrow?

1033
00:55:17,270 --> 00:55:19,390
You know, and you could stay
home and watch him?

1034
00:55:19,430 --> 00:55:21,630
Oh, no. No, I can't stay home
tomorrow,

1035
00:55:21,670 --> 00:55:22,950
I have a budget meeting tomorrow.

1036
00:55:22,950 --> 00:55:24,750
Well, honey, I can't take off,

1037
00:55:24,790 --> 00:55:26,190
I'm one... one bad pitch away

1038
00:55:26,190 --> 00:55:27,510
From getting fired... one.

1039
00:55:27,550 --> 00:55:30,350
Well, I tell you what, I have
an idea then.

1040
00:55:30,390 --> 00:55:33,150
Why don't you take buddy to
work with you?

1041
00:55:40,190 --> 00:55:42,270
Hey, Walter. Morning, jack.

1042
00:55:42,310 --> 00:55:43,870
Morning, jack.

1043
00:55:44,470 --> 00:55:45,390
Oh, good morning, Mr. Hobbs.

1044
00:55:45,430 --> 00:55:46,870
Good morning, Sarah. Good
morning, Sarah.

1045
00:55:46,910 --> 00:55:49,830
That's a nice purple dress.
It's very purple-y

1046
00:55:49,870 --> 00:55:51,230
Francisco. How's it going, Mr.
Hobbs?

1047
00:55:51,270 --> 00:55:55,190
Francisco, that's fun to say..."
Francisco."

1048
00:55:56,390 --> 00:55:57,550
Hi! Hi.

1049
00:55:57,590 --> 00:55:58,430
Do you remember me?

1050
00:55:58,470 --> 00:56:00,310
I do. I didn't recognize you.

1051
00:56:00,350 --> 00:56:02,150
I know, I'm in work clothes.

1052
00:56:05,510 --> 00:56:07,430
Thank you, Deborah.

1053
00:56:07,470 --> 00:56:08,430
Thanks, deb.

1054
00:56:08,470 --> 00:56:09,750
Deb, you have such a pretty face.

1055
00:56:09,790 --> 00:56:11,070
You should be on a Christmas card.

1056
00:56:11,110 --> 00:56:13,430
You just made my day.

1057
00:56:20,950 --> 00:56:22,390
Eww.

1058
00:56:24,990 --> 00:56:26,150
Buddy. Hmm?

1059
00:56:26,190 --> 00:56:28,070
You don't have to drink that.

1060
00:56:28,110 --> 00:56:29,550
Thank you.

1061
00:56:39,230 --> 00:56:41,150
Francisco.

1062
00:56:42,230 --> 00:56:44,670
Francisco.

1063
00:56:45,910 --> 00:56:47,630
Francisco.

1064
00:56:47,670 --> 00:56:49,230
Francisco.

1065
00:56:49,270 --> 00:56:50,750
Buddy?

1066
00:56:52,990 --> 00:56:54,270
Just... just a little.

1067
00:57:01,630 --> 00:57:02,230
Yes, bud?

1068
00:57:02,230 --> 00:57:04,790
Why is your name on the desk?

1069
00:57:04,830 --> 00:57:06,870
I bought the desk.

1070
00:57:06,910 --> 00:57:09,590
My name's there so no one
steals it.

1071
00:57:11,390 --> 00:57:13,110
That's a joke, isn't it, dad?

1072
00:57:13,150 --> 00:57:15,630
Yeah, buddy, that's a joke.

1073
00:57:15,670 --> 00:57:18,110
So, what are we gonna build?

1074
00:57:18,150 --> 00:57:19,390
No, uh, we don't do

1075
00:57:19,430 --> 00:57:21,110
That kind of work here, pal.

1076
00:57:22,270 --> 00:57:24,470
Buddy the elf, what's your
favorite color?

1077
00:57:24,510 --> 00:57:25,790
Put that down. Hello?

1078
00:57:25,830 --> 00:57:28,070
Hello? Dial tone

1079
00:57:29,310 --> 00:57:31,710
Please, don't touch anything.

1080
00:57:31,710 --> 00:57:33,110
Sorry.

1081
00:57:36,350 --> 00:57:37,750
Hey...

1082
00:57:39,390 --> 00:57:41,430
Bud, have you... have you...

1083
00:57:41,470 --> 00:57:43,430
Have you ever seen a mailroom?

1084
00:57:43,470 --> 00:57:44,630
A mailroom? No.

1085
00:57:44,670 --> 00:57:45,790
No? No.

1086
00:57:45,790 --> 00:57:46,590
Oh, I mean, wow.

1087
00:57:46,590 --> 00:57:49,230
Wow... listen, it's a
place where mail

1088
00:57:49,270 --> 00:57:50,190
From all over the world
comes,

1089
00:57:50,230 --> 00:57:52,830
Uh-huh. And they sort it
out there, see?

1090
00:57:52,830 --> 00:57:53,750
And you can touch it all,

1091
00:57:53,790 --> 00:57:55,550
And they put it in these
shiny bins.

1092
00:57:55,550 --> 00:57:56,990
Shiny bins? Right.

1093
00:57:56,990 --> 00:57:59,390
What do ya think? It
sounds great.

1094
00:57:59,430 --> 00:58:00,390
Good.

1095
00:58:00,430 --> 00:58:01,870
Can we go there?

1096
00:58:01,910 --> 00:58:02,590
Well, um...

1097
00:58:02,630 --> 00:58:05,710
I gotta work here, maybe... maybe
you can work there.

1098
00:58:05,750 --> 00:58:06,950
Okay, I'll work there.

1099
00:58:09,390 --> 00:58:11,510
Oh, I don't think this is
the place

1100
00:58:11,550 --> 00:58:12,710
My dad was talking about.

1101
00:58:12,750 --> 00:58:14,190
Is there a different mailroom?

1102
00:58:14,230 --> 00:58:16,350
No. This is the only one.

1103
00:58:16,350 --> 00:58:18,470
It's not very shiny.

1104
00:58:18,590 --> 00:58:22,430
Now... over here's the trench.

1105
00:58:22,430 --> 00:58:24,470
All the mail comes out that
shooter.

1106
00:58:24,510 --> 00:58:28,710
Scan and find the floor each
piece is moving to.

1107
00:58:28,750 --> 00:58:29,630
Put it in a canister

1108
00:58:29,670 --> 00:58:33,150
And shove it up the tube with
the same number.

1109
00:58:33,190 --> 00:58:34,510
You got that?

1110
00:58:34,550 --> 00:58:35,870
I think so.

1111
00:58:35,870 --> 00:58:38,750
This place reminds me of
Santa's workshop.

1112
00:58:38,790 --> 00:58:40,190
Except it smells like mushrooms,

1113
00:58:40,230 --> 00:58:43,150
And everyone looks like they
wanna hurt me.

1114
00:58:43,430 --> 00:58:45,350
Uh, greenway's coming in tomorrow,

1115
00:58:45,350 --> 00:58:46,870
So, what... what do we got?

1116
00:58:46,910 --> 00:58:48,870
Well, Morris and I have been
brainstorming,

1117
00:58:48,870 --> 00:58:51,230
And we've come up with what I
think

1118
00:58:51,270 --> 00:58:52,590
Is a pretty big idea.

1119
00:58:52,630 --> 00:58:53,070
Great, what?

1120
00:58:53,110 --> 00:58:55,550
You're gonna love it, it's
fantastic.

1121
00:58:55,590 --> 00:58:56,470
What?

1122
00:58:56,510 --> 00:58:59,670
Okay, picture this...

1123
00:58:59,710 --> 00:59:02,830
We bring in miles finch.

1124
00:59:03,710 --> 00:59:05,230
The miles finch?

1125
00:59:05,270 --> 00:59:06,430
The golden ghost.

1126
00:59:06,430 --> 00:59:07,550
We bring him in!

1127
00:59:07,590 --> 00:59:10,310
He's written more classics than dr.
Seuss.

1128
00:59:10,350 --> 00:59:11,270
I tain't gonna be easy,

1129
00:59:11,310 --> 00:59:12,870
But I think it's worth a shot.

1130
00:59:12,870 --> 00:59:17,350
My two top writers, my crack team,
my fun squad...

1131
00:59:17,350 --> 00:59:18,950
You came in here pitching me

1132
00:59:18,950 --> 00:59:21,390
The idea of hiring another writer?

1133
00:59:21,430 --> 00:59:22,430
Yeah.

1134
00:59:22,470 --> 00:59:24,510
Miles finch.

1135
00:59:27,110 --> 00:59:29,550
I like it. Chuckles

1136
00:59:30,670 --> 00:59:31,590
I like it.

1137
00:59:31,590 --> 00:59:33,590
Then I traveled through the seven
levels

1138
00:59:33,630 --> 00:59:34,510
Of the candy cane forest

1139
00:59:34,550 --> 00:59:38,630
And past the sea of swirly-twirly
gumdrops.

1140
00:59:38,670 --> 00:59:41,030
Ooh!

1141
00:59:41,030 --> 00:59:43,950
Wow... it's sucky.

1142
00:59:43,990 --> 00:59:46,350
Ohh, it's wonderful. Yes!

1143
00:59:46,390 --> 00:59:48,710
That is marvelous how that...

1144
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:50,390
Oh!

1145
00:59:50,430 --> 00:59:52,830
Oh, it's very sucky.

1146
00:59:52,870 --> 00:59:55,270
It's very... sucky.

1147
00:59:55,270 --> 00:59:56,510
Whoo.

1148
00:59:56,550 --> 00:59:58,310
So, how'd you get here?

1149
00:59:58,350 --> 00:59:59,750
Work release.

1150
00:59:59,750 --> 01:00:00,790
Mm.

1151
01:00:00,830 --> 01:00:03,270
Oh, syrup and coffee?

1152
01:00:03,270 --> 01:00:06,470
Why didn't I think of that? Can I
try some?

1153
01:00:06,470 --> 01:00:07,550
Be my guest.

1154
01:00:07,590 --> 01:00:08,990
Very generous of you.

1155
01:00:09,030 --> 01:00:13,230
Mmm. I love syrup.

1156
01:00:15,150 --> 01:00:17,270
Ohh, I love it.

1157
01:00:18,470 --> 01:00:20,350
Mmm...

1158
01:00:20,390 --> 01:00:23,070
You know, I know I sound like a
broken record,

1159
01:00:23,110 --> 01:00:23,990
But we are buddies.

1160
01:00:24,030 --> 01:00:26,190
You're my best friend, that's it.

1161
01:00:26,190 --> 01:00:26,870
You're my best friend.

1162
01:00:26,910 --> 01:00:29,510
You know, buddy, nobody around
here listens to me.

1163
01:00:29,550 --> 01:00:31,590
I got really good ideas. Yeah?
I believe it.

1164
01:00:31,630 --> 01:00:33,550
I know, I'm right, I listen to you.

1165
01:00:33,550 --> 01:00:34,430
You have great ideas.

1166
01:00:34,470 --> 01:00:36,270
I just try to go with the flow,
you know?

1167
01:00:36,310 --> 01:00:37,390
Good, you go with the flow.

1168
01:00:37,430 --> 01:00:38,430
Yeah. Go with the flow.

1169
01:00:38,470 --> 01:00:39,790
No, I gotta get out of the flow.

1170
01:00:39,830 --> 01:00:41,070
Well, then get out of the flow.

1171
01:00:41,110 --> 01:00:42,230
I'm in the flow, that's what got
me here.

1172
01:00:42,270 --> 01:00:45,550
I gotta... I'm 26 years old, I got
nothing to show for it.

1173
01:00:45,590 --> 01:00:47,470
You're young. You're so young.

1174
01:00:48,430 --> 01:00:49,190
My papa... yeah?

1175
01:00:49,230 --> 01:00:53,670
He didn't make master tinker till
he was 490,so...

1176
01:00:56,430 --> 01:00:58,070
Four-hundred and ninety? Yeah.

1177
01:00:59,510 --> 01:01:01,910
Tickle fight! Tickle fight!

1178
01:01:01,950 --> 01:01:04,270
Tickle fight! Tickle fight!

1179
01:01:04,310 --> 01:01:07,670
My favorite book of yours has
gotta be Gus' pickles.

1180
01:01:07,710 --> 01:01:10,750
It's existential, yet it's so
accessible.

1181
01:01:10,790 --> 01:01:13,590
Uh, Mr. Finch, uh, Eugene Dupris
here.

1182
01:01:13,590 --> 01:01:16,350
It's a thrill just to be talking
to you

1183
01:01:16,390 --> 01:01:17,510
On our speakerphone.

1184
01:01:17,550 --> 01:01:19,470
Miles, um, so, what do you think?

1185
01:01:19,510 --> 01:01:20,390
Can you fly in tomorrow?

1186
01:01:20,430 --> 01:01:22,590
I'll give you five hours tomorrow,

1187
01:01:22,630 --> 01:01:23,750
Not a minute more.

1188
01:01:23,790 --> 01:01:24,750
Oh, that's... that's great.

1189
01:01:24,790 --> 01:01:28,270
I'd like a black s500to receive
me at the airport.

1190
01:01:28,310 --> 01:01:30,030
I need the interior of that car

1191
01:01:30,030 --> 01:01:31,950
To be 71 degrees exactly.

1192
01:01:31,950 --> 01:01:33,630
We can do that.
Mr. Hobbs?

1193
01:01:33,670 --> 01:01:35,310
There's a situation downstairs.

1194
01:01:35,350 --> 01:01:36,430
I'm sorry, what?

1195
01:01:36,470 --> 01:01:37,630
No, hold on, miles. Deb, hang up.

1196
01:01:37,670 --> 01:01:39,710
I do not hold. Do not put
me on hold.

1197
01:01:39,750 --> 01:01:42,230
We have a problem in the
mailroom.

1198
01:01:42,270 --> 01:01:43,070
What's going on?

1199
01:01:43,110 --> 01:01:45,030
Don't speak... Deborah, hang up!

1200
01:01:45,070 --> 01:01:46,950
That's it, I'm gone. Miles!

1201
01:01:49,710 --> 01:01:52,190
I'll be there tomorrow... 71
degrees.

1202
01:01:52,230 --> 01:01:54,670
Sir, chuck in the mailroom

1203
01:01:54,710 --> 01:01:56,110
Needs to talk to you.

1204
01:01:56,150 --> 01:01:57,470
Chuck... what, chuck?

1205
01:01:57,510 --> 01:01:58,950
I mean, what could be going on
down there

1206
01:01:58,990 --> 01:02:00,950
That's so important you had to
interrupt me, what?

1207
01:02:00,950 --> 01:02:02,790
Whoomp, there it is! A little
louder

1208
01:02:02,830 --> 01:02:04,630
Whoomp, there it is! Come on, y'all

1209
01:02:04,630 --> 01:02:06,430
Whoomp! There it is

1210
01:02:06,470 --> 01:02:07,830
Upside down and inside out hey!

01:02:07,830 --> 01:02:09,150
I'm 'bout to show all you folks

1212
01:02:09,190 --> 01:02:10,510
What it's all about hey!

1213
01:02:10,550 --> 01:02:11,710
Time for me to get on the mike

1214
01:02:11,750 --> 01:02:13,270
And make this mother of a party
hype

1215
01:02:13,270 --> 01:02:14,830
I'm taking you back to the old
school

1216
01:02:14,870 --> 01:02:16,350
'cause I'm an old fool who's so cool

1217
01:02:16,390 --> 01:02:18,110
If you wanna get down, I'm gonna
show you the way

1218
01:02:18,150 --> 01:02:20,150
Whoomp, there it is, let me hear

1219
01:02:20,190 --> 01:02:22,230
Whoomp, there it is! Come on, y'all

1220
01:02:22,270 --> 01:02:24,230
Whoomp! There it is a little louder

1221
01:02:24,270 --> 01:02:26,190
Whoomp, there it is! Come on, y'all

1222
01:02:26,230 --> 01:02:27,790
Whoomp, there it is!

1223
01:02:30,110 --> 01:02:30,550
Coming.

1224
01:02:35,990 --> 01:02:37,350
Hi.

1225
01:02:37,350 --> 01:02:38,670
Wow.

1226
01:02:38,710 --> 01:02:40,350
You look miraculous.

1227
01:02:40,390 --> 01:02:41,670
So do you.

1228
01:02:41,710 --> 01:02:42,910
Thank you.

1229
01:02:42,950 --> 01:02:44,870
What would you like to do?

1230
01:02:44,910 --> 01:02:46,870
I got some ideas.

1231
01:02:50,790 --> 01:02:54,550
Just reach out in front of you and
and take a sip.

1232
01:02:54,590 --> 01:02:57,870
Don't look. There you go.

1233
01:02:59,950 --> 01:03:01,350
Well?

1234
01:03:01,710 --> 01:03:04,310
It tastes like a crappy cup
of coffee.

1235
01:03:04,310 --> 01:03:06,470
No.

1236
01:03:07,990 --> 01:03:09,590
It is a crappy cup of coffee.

1237
01:03:09,630 --> 01:03:11,990
No, it's the world's best cup
of coffee.

1238
01:03:12,030 --> 01:03:15,630
The trick is to not get your arm caught
in the door!

1239
01:03:15,670 --> 01:03:18,990
Also, never close your eyes' cause
then

1240
01:03:19,030 --> 01:03:22,550
Okay, when you feel comfortable, you
just jump in!

1241
01:03:22,590 --> 01:03:24,190
what are you doing?

1242
01:03:24,230 --> 01:03:27,150
I'm skipping. I'm skipping.
I'm skipping.

1243
01:03:27,190 --> 01:03:30,070
Wait, wait, wait... one more, one more.

1244
01:03:30,110 --> 01:03:32,670
Now, look at the size of this one.

1245
01:03:37,950 --> 01:03:39,750
Come with me.

1246
01:03:40,550 --> 01:03:41,590
Watch out.

1247
01:03:41,630 --> 01:03:43,590
Yellow ones don't stop.

1248
01:03:43,630 --> 01:03:45,550
The yellow ones don't stop.

1249
01:03:50,790 --> 01:03:54,750
Wow... that's a big one.

1250
01:04:14,670 --> 01:04:15,950
I'm sorry.

1251
01:04:15,990 --> 01:04:17,230
You missed.

1252
01:04:17,270 --> 01:04:19,110
What do you mean I missed?

1253
01:04:19,150 --> 01:04:20,590
You missed.

1254
01:04:39,590 --> 01:04:41,150
Miles finch.

1255
01:04:41,150 --> 01:04:42,670
Miles finch.

1256
01:04:44,510 --> 01:04:46,350
Miles finch.

1257
01:04:48,830 --> 01:04:50,110
All right, let's do this.

1258
01:04:50,150 --> 01:04:52,390
Miles, I'm so happy you could come
Uh...

1259
01:04:52,430 --> 01:04:52,750
Yeah.

1260
01:04:52,790 --> 01:04:55,310
I'm Walter Hobbs. Yeah, let's get
the, uh...

1261
01:04:55,350 --> 01:04:57,830
Taken care of so we can get started
here.

1262
01:04:57,870 --> 01:04:59,510
Here you go.

1263
01:05:00,990 --> 01:05:02,310
Great.

1264
01:05:02,350 --> 01:05:04,750
All right... clears throat

1265
01:05:04,790 --> 01:05:07,110
What have you guys got so far?

1266
01:05:07,150 --> 01:05:08,390
Go ahead.

1267
01:05:08,430 --> 01:05:09,630
Uh...

1268
01:05:09,630 --> 01:05:12,750
We were thinking, uh, something
like this, uh...

1269
01:05:12,790 --> 01:05:14,630
We open on a young tomato.

1270
01:05:14,670 --> 01:05:16,710
He's had some tough times down
at the farm

1271
01:05:16,750 --> 01:05:18,510
With, you know, a rabbit, and...

1272
01:05:18,550 --> 01:05:20,030
No. No tomatoes...

1273
01:05:20,070 --> 01:05:21,470
Too vulnerable.

1274
01:05:21,510 --> 01:05:23,030
Kids, they're already vulnerable.

1275
01:05:23,030 --> 01:05:24,670
No, you see? I... I told you guys.

1276
01:05:24,710 --> 01:05:26,310
I told them the very same thing...

1277
01:05:26,310 --> 01:05:26,910
And no farms.

1278
01:05:26,950 --> 01:05:29,270
Every body's pushing small town
rural.

1279
01:05:29,310 --> 01:05:31,590
A farm book would just be white
noise.

1280
01:05:31,630 --> 01:05:32,390
What about this?

1281
01:05:32,430 --> 01:05:35,270
Uh, a tribe of asparagus children,

1282
01:05:35,310 --> 01:05:39,750
But they're self-conscious about
the way their pee smells.

1283
01:05:44,070 --> 01:05:46,510
Apparently, all we have is
vegetables.

1284
01:05:46,550 --> 01:05:47,750
I have no time, so, you know,

1285
01:05:47,790 --> 01:05:48,910
If you've got a story here...

1286
01:05:48,950 --> 01:05:51,630
I've got about five or six great
starts here.

1287
01:05:51,670 --> 01:05:53,630
I've got one idea that
I'm especially

1288
01:05:53,670 --> 01:05:55,750
Psyched out of my mind about.

1289
01:05:55,790 --> 01:05:57,550
You know, it's one of those ideas

1290
01:05:57,590 --> 01:05:59,350
Where you're just like, uh...

1291
01:05:59,390 --> 01:06:00,230
Yes!

1292
01:06:00,230 --> 01:06:02,350
Whoa!

1293
01:06:02,390 --> 01:06:04,670
Uh, great, c-could we hear it?

1294
01:06:04,710 --> 01:06:07,910
I'll start with the cover.
Picture this... you got, uh

1295
01:06:07,950 --> 01:06:10,590
Dad! I'm in love, I'm in love,

1296
01:06:10,630 --> 01:06:13,190
And I don't care who knows it!

1297
01:06:13,230 --> 01:06:13,870
Buddy, not now, uh,

1298
01:06:13,910 --> 01:06:16,110
Can you please go back to the...
to the pit?

1299
01:06:16,150 --> 01:06:18,310
I'll come and visit you in a
little while, okay?

1300
01:06:18,310 --> 01:06:21,630
I didn't know you had elves
working here.

1301
01:06:21,670 --> 01:06:26,350
Oh... boy, you're... you're hilarious,
my friend.

1302
01:06:26,390 --> 01:06:28,550
He doesn't, uh... get back to

1303
01:06:28,550 --> 01:06:31,110
The story, please. All right, okay.

1304
01:06:32,230 --> 01:06:33,630
So, on the cover above the title...

1305
01:06:33,670 --> 01:06:35,910
Does Santa know that you left the
workshop?

1306
01:06:35,950 --> 01:06:38,150
You know, we're all laughing our
heads off.

1307
01:06:38,150 --> 01:06:40,230
Did you have to borrow a reindeer
to get down here?

1308
01:06:40,270 --> 01:06:41,990
Buddy... go back to the basement.

1309
01:06:42,030 --> 01:06:43,470
Hey, jack weed,

1310
01:06:43,510 --> 01:06:45,030
I get more action in a week

1311
01:06:45,030 --> 01:06:46,350
Than you've had your entire life.

1312
01:06:46,390 --> 01:06:49,870
I've got houses in I.e., Paris,
and Vail,

1313
01:06:49,870 --> 01:06:51,190
Oh. Each one of them

1314
01:06:51,230 --> 01:06:53,150
with a 70-inchplasma screen.

1315
01:06:53,190 --> 01:06:54,550
So, I suggest you wipe

1316
01:06:54,590 --> 01:06:55,910
That stupid smile off your face

1317
01:06:55,950 --> 01:06:58,390
Before I come over there and smack
it off!

1318
01:06:58,430 --> 01:06:59,990
You feeling strong, my friend?!

1319
01:07:00,030 --> 01:07:03,270
Call me elf one more time!

1320
01:07:07,110 --> 01:07:09,830
He's an angry elf.

1321
01:07:12,430 --> 01:07:15,230
Look at you.

1322
01:07:17,070 --> 01:07:18,990
Ow! Hey, what...

1323
01:07:18,990 --> 01:07:19,710
Aah!

1324
01:07:19,750 --> 01:07:21,390
I wasn't ready for that.

1325
01:07:21,390 --> 01:07:23,550
Aah! Hey, hey, hey!

1326
01:07:23,590 --> 01:07:25,710
Hey, hey, hey! Whoa!

1327
01:07:25,750 --> 01:07:26,190
Ooh...

1328
01:07:26,190 --> 01:07:28,110
Call me elf one more time!

1329
01:07:28,110 --> 01:07:29,790
Call me elf!

1330
01:07:29,830 --> 01:07:31,470
You're an elf.

1331
01:07:36,590 --> 01:07:40,150
Miles, I'm sorry, he... he thinks
he's an elf.

1332
01:07:41,070 --> 01:07:41,830
Listen, miles...

1333
01:07:41,870 --> 01:07:44,270
Listen, miles! Door slams

1334
01:07:44,270 --> 01:07:46,630
He must be a South Pole elf.

1335
01:07:48,910 --> 01:07:50,510
You get the hell outta here.

1336
01:07:50,550 --> 01:07:51,790
Where do you want me to go?

1337
01:07:51,830 --> 01:07:53,030
I don't care where you go.

1338
01:07:53,070 --> 01:07:54,270
I don't care that you're an elf!

1339
01:07:54,310 --> 01:07:55,950
I don't care that you're nuts!

1340
01:07:55,990 --> 01:07:57,630
I don't care that you're my son!

1341
01:07:57,670 --> 01:08:00,430
Get out of my life now!

1342
01:08:10,470 --> 01:08:11,430
Hi, it's me.

1343
01:08:11,470 --> 01:08:12,910
I really can't talk right now.

1344
01:08:12,950 --> 01:08:15,150
Well, just tell me how the pitch
went.

1345
01:08:15,150 --> 01:08:17,830
I'm gonna be a little later than
I thought, okay?

1346
01:08:17,870 --> 01:08:19,990
Well, don't be too late, Walter,

1347
01:08:20,030 --> 01:08:21,670
It's Christmas Eve.

1348
01:08:21,710 --> 01:08:23,310
Walter... wait, um.

1349
01:08:23,310 --> 01:08:25,390
Honey, I gotta go, okay? Love ya.

1350
01:08:25,430 --> 01:08:27,470
Oh, say hi to buddy.

1351
01:08:28,310 --> 01:08:29,830
What? Walter, breakthrough.

1352
01:08:29,870 --> 01:08:31,990
We found this in the conference
room.

1353
01:08:32,030 --> 01:08:32,430
What is it?

1354
01:08:32,470 --> 01:08:34,310
It's miles finch's notebook.

1355
01:08:34,350 --> 01:08:37,390
This thing is chock full of
genius ideas.

1356
01:08:37,430 --> 01:08:37,990
I mean, look at that.

1357
01:08:38,030 --> 01:08:41,750
And his best idea is about a
peach that lives on a farm.

1358
01:08:41,750 --> 01:08:43,950
What's more vulnerable than a
peach?

1359
01:08:43,990 --> 01:08:44,550
What, uh, what do we do?

1360
01:08:44,590 --> 01:08:47,790
I think we should go with the
first pitch... it's genius.

1361
01:08:47,830 --> 01:08:48,390
Uh, how much time we got?

1362
01:08:48,430 --> 01:08:50,230
We got, like, 45 minutes. Well,
come on, let's, uh,

1363
01:08:50,230 --> 01:08:52,150
Try to get a storyboard or
something ready.

1364
01:08:52,150 --> 01:08:53,310
Come on, let's do it. Just try.

1365
01:08:53,350 --> 01:08:55,750
No, you can't sit down and get a
storyboard ready.

1366
01:08:55,790 --> 01:08:57,230
Go and get a storyboard ready.

1367
01:08:57,270 --> 01:08:59,390
Oh, boy! Go.

1368
01:09:01,910 --> 01:09:05,310
"I'm sorry I ruined your lives

1369
01:09:05,350 --> 01:09:10,070
"And crammed 11 cookies into
the vcr.

1370
01:09:10,070 --> 01:09:15,270
"I don't belong here. I don't
belong anywhere.

1371
01:09:15,670 --> 01:09:20,990
I'll never forget you. Love,
buddy."

1372
01:09:21,030 --> 01:09:22,390
God...

1373
01:09:33,070 --> 01:09:34,510
Hey, buddy.

1374
01:09:37,030 --> 01:09:38,430
Buddy?

1375
01:09:44,110 --> 01:09:46,070
As you know, we need a big
launch fast

1376
01:09:46,110 --> 01:09:47,350
To get the company back on
track.

1377
01:09:47,390 --> 01:09:50,510
So, I think I speak for my fellow
board members

1378
01:09:50,550 --> 01:09:53,550
When I say... this better be good.

1379
01:09:53,590 --> 01:09:56,030
Before I get into the story, uh,

1380
01:09:56,070 --> 01:09:58,470
Let me start with the cover, okay?

1381
01:09:58,510 --> 01:10:00,670
Now, just picture this...

1382
01:10:00,710 --> 01:10:02,550
Dad! I gotta talk to you.

1383
01:10:02,590 --> 01:10:04,390
Michael, what is it?

1384
01:10:04,430 --> 01:10:05,590
Buddy ran away.

1385
01:10:05,630 --> 01:10:07,910
What? He... he left a note.

1386
01:10:07,950 --> 01:10:10,150
I'm scared, dad, he's gone.

1387
01:10:10,190 --> 01:10:12,550
Uh, let me just finish this
meeting,

1388
01:10:12,590 --> 01:10:14,870
And then, um, we'll figure it
out, okay?

1389
01:10:14,910 --> 01:10:19,150
Figure out what? Buddy cares
about everybody.

1390
01:10:19,190 --> 01:10:21,230
All you care about is yourself.

1391
01:10:22,910 --> 01:10:25,270
Hey, Michael.

1392
01:10:25,950 --> 01:10:27,350
Wait.

1393
01:10:30,510 --> 01:10:33,870
We're gonna have to reschedule
this, uh, Mr. Greenway.

1394
01:10:33,910 --> 01:10:35,230
We don't have time to reschedule.

1395
01:10:35,270 --> 01:10:36,550
I wanna hear the damn thing now.

1396
01:10:36,590 --> 01:10:37,670
Son, you'll have to wait.

1397
01:10:37,710 --> 01:10:41,590
No, d-don't tell my kid what
to do, uh...

1398
01:10:42,110 --> 01:10:44,950
Can't... can't we do this another
time, Mr. Greenway?

1399
01:10:44,990 --> 01:10:47,630
I flew in just to hear this pitch,

1400
01:10:47,670 --> 01:10:48,870
And I intend to.

1401
01:10:48,910 --> 01:10:50,310
It's gonna have to wait.

1402
01:10:50,350 --> 01:10:52,270
If you wanna keep your job, Hobbs,

1403
01:10:52,310 --> 01:10:55,150
You will pitch me this book
right now.

1404
01:11:01,870 --> 01:11:04,790
Well... up yours.

1405
01:11:04,830 --> 01:11:07,710
Yeah, up yours. Hey.

1406
01:11:09,070 --> 01:11:10,510
Hobbs... Hobbs!

1407
01:11:10,550 --> 01:11:12,230
Hobbs, you walk out of here,

1408
01:11:12,270 --> 01:11:14,710
And... and you're finished at
greenway!

1409
01:11:14,750 --> 01:11:16,190
You're finished!

1410
01:11:32,710 --> 01:11:35,590
I don't belong anywhere.

1411
01:11:37,790 --> 01:11:39,670
Buddy!

1412
01:11:39,710 --> 01:11:41,550
Buddy!

1413
01:11:41,590 --> 01:11:43,670
Buddy, where are you?!

1414
01:11:50,830 --> 01:11:55,070
Prancer, pull! Come on! Come on!

1415
01:11:55,110 --> 01:11:58,470
Vixen, up, up!

1416
01:11:58,510 --> 01:12:00,510
Santa?

1417
01:12:00,910 --> 01:12:03,790
Come on, you can do it.

1418
01:12:03,830 --> 01:12:07,270
Pull up! Pull up!

1419
01:12:14,790 --> 01:12:16,790
Dad! What?

1420
01:12:16,830 --> 01:12:18,270
Michael, where you going?

1421
01:12:18,310 --> 01:12:19,590
Michael!

1422
01:12:36,950 --> 01:12:37,310
Santa.

1423
01:12:37,350 --> 01:12:41,830
Back off, slick. You'll scare
the deer.

1424
01:12:41,870 --> 01:12:44,510
Buddy, is that you?

1425
01:12:44,550 --> 01:12:45,390
Are you okay?

1426
01:12:45,430 --> 01:12:47,910
Boy, am I glad to see you.

1427
01:12:47,910 --> 01:12:51,670
The Claus meter suddenly just
dropped down to zero.

1428
01:12:51,710 --> 01:12:55,150
There's just no Christmas
spirit anymore.

1429
01:12:55,190 --> 01:12:58,070
And then the strain was too
Much...

1430
01:12:58,070 --> 01:13:00,910
The engine broke free of her
mounts.

1431
01:13:05,670 --> 01:13:08,110
I need an elf's help.

1432
01:13:08,150 --> 01:13:10,550
I... I'm not an elf, Santa.

1433
01:13:10,590 --> 01:13:12,910
I... I can't do anything right.

1434
01:13:12,950 --> 01:13:17,590
Buddy, you're more of an elf than
anyone I ever met,

1435
01:13:17,630 --> 01:13:19,910
And the only one who I would want

1436
01:13:19,950 --> 01:13:22,190
Working on my sleigh tonight.

1437
01:13:22,190 --> 01:13:24,030
Really? Really.

1438
01:13:24,070 --> 01:13:26,590
Will you fix it for me, buddy?

1439
01:13:26,590 --> 01:13:29,070
I'll try. Papa taught me how.

1440
01:13:29,110 --> 01:13:29,830
You gotta find it first.

1441
01:13:29,870 --> 01:13:32,590
It dropped off the sleigh back
over there a ways.

1442
01:13:32,590 --> 01:13:35,390
The engine? The engine, yeah.

1443
01:13:35,430 --> 01:13:38,350
Go, buddy. Go, Mr. Elf!

1444
01:13:39,710 --> 01:13:41,270
I'm standing here outside
central park

1445
01:13:41,310 --> 01:13:44,710
Where it is unclear exactly
what has happened.

1446
01:13:44,750 --> 01:13:46,510
What we do know is that
authorities

1447
01:13:46,550 --> 01:13:47,310
Have closed the park

1448
01:13:47,350 --> 01:13:48,550
And are in the process of
clearing it.

1449
01:13:48,590 --> 01:13:51,190
The only thing that people can
seem to agree on here

1450
01:13:51,230 --> 01:13:54,550
Is that they saw something fall
from the sky.

1451
01:13:54,590 --> 01:13:55,750
I've got an eyewitness with me

1452
01:13:55,790 --> 01:13:57,870
Who claims to have seen the whole
thing firsthand.

1453
01:13:57,910 --> 01:13:59,030
What did you actually see?

1454
01:13:59,070 --> 01:14:01,510
You know, I was walking around and
I saw this thing,

1455
01:14:01,550 --> 01:14:03,670
And my daughter actually pointed
it out to me.

1456
01:14:03,710 --> 01:14:04,710
Oh, your daughter saw it?

1457
01:14:04,750 --> 01:14:05,670
Sweetheart, can you tell me

1458
01:14:05,710 --> 01:14:07,950
What you saw falling out of the
sky?

1459
01:14:07,990 --> 01:14:09,590
It was Santa's sleigh!

1460
01:14:11,150 --> 01:14:12,950
Santa's sleigh, well, there you
have it.

1461
01:14:12,990 --> 01:14:13,750
Santa's in Manhattan.

1462
01:14:13,790 --> 01:14:16,830
Sorry to interrupt your first big
news story, charlotte,

1463
01:14:16,870 --> 01:14:18,910
But New York one has just received

1464
01:14:18,950 --> 01:14:20,950
Some exclusive amateur news footage

1465
01:14:20,990 --> 01:14:22,950
That you just might Anna follow
up on.

1466
01:14:22,990 --> 01:14:26,230
There seems to be a strange man
dressed as an elf

1467
01:14:26,270 --> 01:14:27,630
Wandering through central park.

1468
01:14:27,670 --> 01:14:30,550
Now, I don't know if this is the
kind of hard-hitting news

1469
01:14:30,590 --> 01:14:32,510
You're used to covering in buffalo,
charlotte,

1470
01:14:32,550 --> 01:14:34,030
Oh, my god. But here at New York one,

1471
01:14:34,070 --> 01:14:36,430
News is top priority.

1472
01:14:46,550 --> 01:14:48,910
What the heck...?

1473
01:14:48,950 --> 01:14:50,750
Hey!

1474
01:14:51,190 --> 01:14:53,750
You found it. Buddy!

1475
01:14:58,990 --> 01:15:00,390
I need to tell you something.

1476
01:15:00,390 --> 01:15:01,430
No, no. Buddy, there's something

1477
01:15:01,470 --> 01:15:02,430
I have to tell you right now.

1478
01:15:02,470 --> 01:15:06,190
Um, I didn't mean anything I said back
there, not word.

1479
01:15:06,230 --> 01:15:10,070
I know you may be a little, um, um...

1480
01:15:10,070 --> 01:15:11,390
Uh, chemically imbalanced,

1481
01:15:11,430 --> 01:15:14,070
But you've been right about a lot
of things.

1482
01:15:14,070 --> 01:15:17,350
I... I don't want you to leave.

1483
01:15:17,390 --> 01:15:20,590
You're my son, and I... love you.

1484
01:15:27,670 --> 01:15:28,390
Uh, buddy, uh...

1485
01:15:28,430 --> 01:15:31,190
What was it you wanted to tell me?

1486
01:15:31,190 --> 01:15:33,430
Oh, right. Come with me.

1487
01:15:33,470 --> 01:15:35,150
Right. Come on.

1488
01:15:41,150 --> 01:15:42,550
I'm herewith another eyewitness

1489
01:15:42,550 --> 01:15:44,790
Who has his own version of what
happened.

1490
01:15:44,790 --> 01:15:45,870
Sir, what did you see?

1491
01:15:45,910 --> 01:15:47,030
I think you're great, charlotte.

1492
01:15:47,070 --> 01:15:48,790
Uh, I saw something fall from the
sky

1493
01:15:48,830 --> 01:15:50,510
Right into the middle of central
park.

1494
01:15:50,550 --> 01:15:52,790
I mean, you're a great news lady.

1495
01:15:52,790 --> 01:15:53,550
Thank you.

1496
01:15:53,590 --> 01:15:54,550
Could you tell me a bit more?

1497
01:15:54,550 --> 01:15:55,830
About what you saw fall from the
sky?

1498
01:15:55,870 --> 01:15:57,070
Yeah, yeah. Your eyes tell the
story,

1499
01:15:57,110 --> 01:15:59,030
That's what I love about you.
You've got a great mouth.

1500
01:15:59,030 --> 01:16:01,350
The thing just dropped in the middle of
central park.

1501
01:16:01,390 --> 01:16:03,670
It was amazing, and everybody's, like,
going crazy.

1502
01:16:03,710 --> 01:16:05,590
Dick, uh, according to authorities,

1503
01:16:05,590 --> 01:16:06,710
The area has been cleared.

1504
01:16:06,750 --> 01:16:10,190
Only the central park rangers now
remain in the park.

1505
01:16:10,230 --> 01:16:11,950
These forces are highly trained,

1506
01:16:11,990 --> 01:16:13,270
But rarely see action.

1507
01:16:13,270 --> 01:16:16,310
Some have accused them of being
too gung ho

1508
01:16:16,350 --> 01:16:17,150
When called into duty,

1509
01:16:17,190 --> 01:16:19,830
And their controversial crowd
control tactics

1510
01:16:19,870 --> 01:16:22,430
At the Simon and Garfunkel concert
in '85

1511
01:16:22,470 --> 01:16:24,670
Are still under investigation.

1512
01:16:24,710 --> 01:16:26,870
I knew you'd find it, Mr. Elf!

1513
01:16:26,870 --> 01:16:30,070
Slap it on real quick, we've got
to get going.

1514
01:16:32,470 --> 01:16:33,590
That ta boy.

1515
01:16:36,510 --> 01:16:39,110
So, uh... you're, uh...

1516
01:16:39,150 --> 01:16:41,750
Santa Claus. Right.

1517
01:16:42,830 --> 01:16:46,630
Would you mind taking this to
your firstborn?

1518
01:16:46,670 --> 01:16:47,110
Sure.

1519
01:16:47,150 --> 01:16:50,230
Um, uh, and my firstborn, he's
an elf?

1520
01:16:50,270 --> 01:16:53,750
Yes. Actually, I'm adopted.

1521
01:16:54,070 --> 01:16:57,910
Uh, Michael, would you open this
hatch for me, please?

1522
01:17:03,390 --> 01:17:05,350
That ta boy, thank you.

1523
01:17:05,390 --> 01:17:08,950
So, you're really Santa Claus?

1524
01:17:08,990 --> 01:17:11,550
You never can tell, kid.

1525
01:17:11,590 --> 01:17:12,350
Tell me, Michael,

1526
01:17:12,390 --> 01:17:14,030
What do you want for Christmas?

1527
01:17:14,070 --> 01:17:17,070
I wanted a skateboard.

1528
01:17:17,070 --> 01:17:20,470
Oh, not just skateboard.

1529
01:17:20,510 --> 01:17:23,870
Arealhuf board. Looked here.

1530
01:17:23,870 --> 01:17:25,230
Looked here...

1531
01:17:25,270 --> 01:17:27,230
How do you like them apples?

1532
01:17:27,270 --> 01:17:29,870
Go look and see.

1533
01:17:35,910 --> 01:17:37,310
Whoa.

1534
01:17:43,750 --> 01:17:44,710
What happened?

1535
01:17:44,750 --> 01:17:47,390
You made my sleigh fly.

1536
01:17:47,430 --> 01:17:48,070
What do you mean?

1537
01:17:48,110 --> 01:17:50,190
Well, before the turbine days,

1538
01:17:50,230 --> 01:17:53,110
This baby used to run solely on
Christmas spirit.

1539
01:17:53,150 --> 01:17:56,390
You believed in me. You made my
sleigh fly.

1540
01:17:56,430 --> 01:17:59,590
Hold it... if you're really Santa
Claus,

1541
01:17:59,630 --> 01:18:01,950
Then we can just get some news
cameras in here,

1542
01:18:01,990 --> 01:18:03,150
And everyone will believe in you,

1543
01:18:03,190 --> 01:18:04,230
Then your sleigh will fly, right?

1544
01:18:04,270 --> 01:18:07,150
Christmas spirit is about believing,
not seeing.

1545
01:18:07,190 --> 01:18:09,990
If the whole world saw me,
all would be lost.

1546
01:18:10,030 --> 01:18:14,030
The paparazzi have been trying to
nail me for years.

1547
01:18:16,710 --> 01:18:18,150
Hey, look!

1548
01:18:26,710 --> 01:18:30,310
It's the central park rangers.

1549
01:18:34,390 --> 01:18:39,470
Dad, Michael... I got a plan.

1550
01:18:46,910 --> 01:18:49,510
Whoa, wait! Wait, Michael...
my list!

1551
01:18:49,510 --> 01:18:52,190
You bring that list back right now,
you hear me?!

1552
01:18:52,230 --> 01:18:54,150
Come on, give me your hat and coat.

1553
01:18:54,190 --> 01:18:56,990
Mrs. Claus made them for me.

1554
01:19:01,070 --> 01:19:03,950
Hey! Hey, here I am!

1555
01:19:05,750 --> 01:19:06,630
Ho ho ho!

1556
01:19:06,670 --> 01:19:11,150
Hey, ho ho ho! Hey! Hey!

1557
01:19:18,230 --> 01:19:20,190
Excuse me. Thank you. Excuse me.

1558
01:19:20,230 --> 01:19:22,070
So the authorities have not
discovered

1559
01:19:22,110 --> 01:19:23,830
Any reindeer in the park?

1560
01:19:23,870 --> 01:19:25,310
No, no reindeer. Sleigh bells?

1561
01:19:25,350 --> 01:19:26,510
No, no sleigh bells, either.

1562
01:19:26,550 --> 01:19:27,670
Elves? Excuse me, please.

1563
01:19:27,710 --> 01:19:28,830
None of that, we really just
need everyone...

1564
01:19:28,870 --> 01:19:29,830
It's him, it's the real Santa!

1565
01:19:29,870 --> 01:19:31,590
His sleigh won't fly,' cause nobody
believes in him!

1566
01:19:31,630 --> 01:19:33,430
Did you see something
in the park?

1567
01:19:33,470 --> 01:19:34,030
Everyone out there,

1568
01:19:34,070 --> 01:19:36,470
Santa needs us to believe,
I can prove he's real.

1569
01:19:36,510 --> 01:19:37,270
Look, this is his list!

1570
01:19:37,310 --> 01:19:40,150
Okay... well, further confirmation

1571
01:19:40,190 --> 01:19:42,670
That there has been a Santa
sighting tonight.

1572
01:19:42,670 --> 01:19:43,710
We have the naughty and nice list.

1573
01:19:43,750 --> 01:19:45,950
Lynn Kessler wants a power puff
girls play set.

1574
01:19:46,430 --> 01:19:48,310
Mark weber wants an electric
guitar.

1575
01:19:48,350 --> 01:19:48,590

Dave keckler wants some Nike

1583
01:20:03,910 --> 01:20:05,990
Okay, uh, well, obviously we have

1584
01:20:06,030 --> 01:20:08,030
A new development in the story, uh,

1585
01:20:08,070 --> 01:20:10,550
A confirmation that Santa must
have been sighted

1586
01:20:10,590 --> 01:20:12,310
Because we have his book right
here.

1587
01:20:12,350 --> 01:20:13,990

1588
01:20:14,030 --> 01:20:17,230

And commit already.

Hey, turn the cameras back on!

1596
01:20:35,510 --> 01:20:36,590
Who told you to say that?

1597
01:20:36,630 --> 01:20:37,430
It's the real Santa.

1598
01:20:37,470 --> 01:20:39,470
We need to get these cameras
back on.

1599
01:20:39,510 --> 01:20:40,590
He needs our help!

1600
01:20:40,630 --> 01:20:42,870
Hey, Michael, are you okay?

1601
01:20:42,910 --> 01:20:43,510
Yeah, I'm fine.

1602
01:20:43,550 --> 01:20:46,670
But buddy, he's... he's in the
park with Santa,

1603
01:20:46,710 --> 01:20:47,830
The sleigh won't fly

1604
01:20:47,870 --> 01:20:49,790
'cause there's no Christmas
spirit.

1605
01:20:49,830 --> 01:20:52,550
Michael! Mom!

1606
01:20:52,590 --> 01:20:55,230
Michael! Ohh!

1607
01:20:55,270 --> 01:20:57,430
Are you okay? I'm fine.

1608
01:20:57,470 --> 01:21:00,350
The best way to spread
Christmas cheer

1609
01:21:00,390 --> 01:21:04,310
Is singing loud for all
to hear.

1610
01:21:08,470 --> 01:21:11,230
Buddy... better get going,
get in now!

1611
01:21:11,270 --> 01:21:13,990
Santa, I'm not done with the
engine yet!

1612
01:21:14,030 --> 01:21:15,190
Can't wait!

1613
01:21:15,230 --> 01:21:17,630
On, dasher, on, dancer...

1614
01:21:17,670 --> 01:21:19,990
I'm not done with the engine!

1615
01:21:23,670 --> 01:21:24,790
That's okay.

1616
01:21:24,830 --> 01:21:27,990
You get started, I'll catch up!

1617
01:21:32,670 --> 01:21:35,110
You know, he wasn't lying.

1618
01:21:35,150 --> 01:21:37,590
Merry Christmas.

1619
01:21:42,230 --> 01:21:44,030
Santa, I can't...

1620
01:21:44,070 --> 01:21:46,550
Stop messing around and get in!

1621
01:21:46,590 --> 01:21:49,750
Aah!

1622
01:21:54,590 --> 01:21:56,630
Santa, why are they chasing us?!

1623
01:21:56,630 --> 01:21:58,630
I put the mon the naughty list,

1624
01:21:58,670 --> 01:22:00,950
And they never forgave me.

1625
01:22:06,110 --> 01:22:09,790
You better watch out,
you better not cry

1626
01:22:09,830 --> 01:22:13,430
You better not pout,
I'm telling you why

1627
01:22:13,470 --> 01:22:18,190
Santa Clausis coming' to town

1628
01:22:18,230 --> 01:22:22,870
Yaah, yaah, yaah!

1629
01:22:23,910 --> 01:22:25,870
Up, up, pull up!

1630
01:22:25,910 --> 01:22:30,070
Buddy! We need power, we're
gonna crash!

1631
01:22:30,070 --> 01:22:33,990
He's making a list,
Checking it twice

1632
01:22:34,030 --> 01:22:37,910
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice

1633
01:22:37,910 --> 01:22:43,190
Santa clausis coming' to town

1634
01:22:43,230 --> 01:22:48,430
He sees you when you're sleeping

1635
01:22:48,470 --> 01:22:51,190
He knows when you're awake

1636
01:22:51,230 --> 01:22:54,870
He knows if you've been bad or good

1637
01:22:54,910 --> 01:22:57,470
So be good for goodness sake

1638
01:22:57,510 --> 01:23:01,670
Oh, you better watch out,
you better not cry

1639
01:23:01,710 --> 01:23:05,830
You better not pout, I'm telling
you why

1640
01:23:05,870 --> 01:23:11,670
Santa Clausis coming to town

1641
01:23:17,750 --> 01:23:18,750
Aah!

1642
01:23:18,750 --> 01:23:21,230
You can do it!
Come on, dancer.

1643
01:23:21,270 --> 01:23:23,150
That's my boy.

1644
01:23:23,190 --> 01:23:25,110
Pull, cupid! Aah!

1645
01:23:25,150 --> 01:23:27,030
Pull, dasher!

1646
01:23:27,070 --> 01:23:31,070
I'm getting too old for this job.

1647
01:23:31,070 --> 01:23:32,510
Now!

1648
01:23:45,270 --> 01:23:46,910
The engine's gone!

1649
01:23:46,910 --> 01:23:48,070
We're toast!

1650
01:23:53,430 --> 01:23:55,550
Well, still no sign of Santa,

1651
01:23:55,590 --> 01:23:57,590
But some spontaneous Christmas
caroling

1652
01:23:57,630 --> 01:23:58,430
Has broken out

1653
01:23:58,470 --> 01:24:00,430
Right herein front of central
park.

1654
01:24:00,470 --> 01:24:01,430
Let's have a listen in.

1655
01:24:01,470 --> 01:24:03,230
He sees you when you're sleeping

1656
01:24:03,270 --> 01:24:06,590
He knows if you're awake

1657
01:24:06,590 --> 01:24:10,430
He knows if you've been bad or
good

1658
01:24:10,430 --> 01:24:14,070
So be good for goodness sake

1659
01:24:14,110 --> 01:24:14,470
Hey!

1660
01:24:14,510 --> 01:24:18,110
You better watch out, you better
not cry

1661
01:24:18,150 --> 01:24:21,750
You better not pout, I'm telling
you why

1662
01:24:21,790 --> 01:24:22,110
Come on!

1663
01:24:22,110 --> 01:24:26,230
Santa claus is coming' to town

1664
01:24:26,270 --> 01:24:30,350
Just a little more!

1665
01:24:35,190 --> 01:24:36,350
Hal-yah!

1666
01:24:36,390 --> 01:24:38,910
He knows when you're awake

1667
01:24:38,950 --> 01:24:40,150
He knows if you've

1668
01:24:40,190 --> 01:24:42,630
Wait... you're not singing.

1669
01:24:42,630 --> 01:24:43,550
Yes, I am.

1670
01:24:43,590 --> 01:24:46,670
No, you're not. You're just moving
your lips.

1671
01:24:46,710 --> 01:24:48,430
Santa!

1672
01:24:48,470 --> 01:24:50,950
Michael, please, what's the big deal?

1673
01:24:50,990 --> 01:24:51,710
Dad.

1674
01:24:51,750 --> 01:24:52,670
I'm telling you why

1675
01:24:52,710 --> 01:24:58,230
Santa clausis coming to town

1676
01:25:06,270 --> 01:25:08,150
Oh! Ha ha ha!

1677
01:25:08,190 --> 01:25:10,230
Now, my beauties!

1678
01:25:17,190 --> 01:25:18,230
Bye-bye.

1679
01:25:18,270 --> 01:25:19,590
Just like the old days!

1680
01:25:19,590 --> 01:25:22,510
Charlotte? Charlotte?

1681
01:25:22,550 --> 01:25:25,150
Well, I guess we'll never know for
sure

1682
01:25:25,190 --> 01:25:27,070
What happened this Christmas Eve?

1683
01:25:27,110 --> 01:25:28,350
In central park.

1684
01:25:28,390 --> 01:25:34,270
Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas!

1685
01:25:34,310 --> 01:25:37,030
Ho ho ho!

1686
01:25:37,070 --> 01:25:39,870
And so, with a little help,

1687
01:25:39,910 --> 01:25:41,750
Buddy managed to save Christmas.

1688
01:25:41,790 --> 01:25:44,550
And his spirit saved a lot of other
People, too.

1689
01:25:44,590 --> 01:25:51,070
Should auld acquaintance be forgot

1690
01:25:51,110 --> 01:25:57,150
And never brought to mind

1691
01:25:57,190 --> 01:26:04,150
Should auld acquaintance be forgot

1692
01:26:04,190 --> 01:26:07,590
Walter started his own independent
publishing company.

1693
01:26:07,630 --> 01:26:10,230
His first book was written by a
brand new,

1694
01:26:10,270 --> 01:26:12,830
Critically acclaimed children's
author.

1695
01:26:12,870 --> 01:26:14,550
The book was elf...

1696
01:26:14,590 --> 01:26:16,230
A, uh, fictional story

1697
01:26:16,270 --> 01:26:18,270
About an adopted elf named buddy

1698
01:26:18,310 --> 01:26:20,270
Who was raised in the North Pole?

1699
01:26:20,270 --> 01:26:22,190
Went to New York, ate spaghetti,

1700
01:26:22,230 --> 01:26:24,510
Worked in a shiny mailroom,

1701
01:26:24,510 --> 01:26:26,710
And eventually saved Christmas.

1702
01:26:26,750 --> 01:26:29,390
"First, I traveled through the
seven levels

1703
01:26:29,430 --> 01:26:31,630
"Of the candy cane forest,

1704
01:26:31,630 --> 01:26:36,030
"Past the sea of twirly-swirly
gumdrops,

1705
01:26:36,070 --> 01:26:40,710
And then, I walked through the
Lincoln tunnel."

1706
01:26:40,750 --> 01:26:42,830
And as for me, I can't complain.

1707
01:26:42,870 --> 01:26:45,190
Buddy comes up to visit from time
to time.

1708
01:26:45,230 --> 01:26:48,590
In the meadow we can build a
snowman

1709
01:26:48,630 --> 01:26:51,950
And pretend that he is parson
brown

1710
01:26:51,990 --> 01:26:55,070
Oh, thank you, Jovie. That's very
sweet of you.

1711
01:26:55,110 --> 01:26:56,510
You're welcome, papa.

1712
01:26:56,550 --> 01:27:00,390
But you can do the job when
you're in town

1713
01:27:00,430 --> 01:27:01,830
Hey, Suzie.

1714
01:27:01,870 --> 01:27:02,710
Come here, little one.

1715
01:27:02,750 --> 01:27:05,190
When it snows, ain't it
thrilling?

1716
01:27:05,230 --> 01:27:06,590
Papa wants to see you.

1717
01:27:06,630 --> 01:27:10,070
Though your nose get a
little chilling

1718
01:27:10,110 --> 01:27:10,430
Buddy...

1719
01:27:10,470 --> 01:27:12,630
We'll frolic and play buddy...
buddy...

1720
01:27:12,670 --> 01:27:18,670
The Eskimo way, walking in a
winter wonderland

1721
01:27:35,230 --> 01:27:39,270
In the meadow we can build a
snowman

1722
01:27:39,310 --> 01:27:43,310
And pretend that he is parson
brown

1723
01:27:43,350 --> 01:27:47,550
He'll say, are you married,
we'll say no, man

1724
01:27:47,590 --> 01:27:51,790
But you can do the job when you
in town, brother

1725
01:27:51,830 --> 01:27:56,190
Later on, we'll conspire

1726
01:27:56,230 --> 01:28:00,550
As we dream by the fire

1727
01:28:00,590 --> 01:28:04,830
To face unafraid the plans
That we made

1728
01:28:04,870 --> 01:28:08,990
Walking in a winter wonderland

1729
01:28:09,030 --> 01:28:13,110
Walking in a winter wonderland

1730
01:28:24,110 --> 01:28:25,470
I really can't stay

1731
01:28:25,510 --> 01:28:29,830
But, baby, it's cold outside

1732
01:28:29,870 --> 01:28:30,870
I've got to go 'way

1733
01:28:30,870 --> 01:28:34,470
But, baby, it's cold outside

1734
01:28:34,510 --> 01:28:36,630
This evening has been

1735
01:28:36,670 --> 01:28:39,310
Been hoping that you'd drop in

1736
01:28:39,350 --> 01:28:40,630
So very nice

1737
01:28:40,670 --> 01:28:45,670
I'll hold your hands, they're
just like ice

1738
01:28:45,710 --> 01:28:48,110
My mother will start to worry

1739
01:28:48,150 --> 01:28:50,510
Beautiful, what's your hurry?

1740
01:28:50,550 --> 01:28:53,790
And father will be pacing the floor

1741
01:28:53,830 --> 01:28:56,230
Listen to that fireplace roar

1742
01:28:56,270 --> 01:28:58,590
So, really, I'd better scurry

1743
01:28:58,630 --> 01:29:00,870
Beautiful, please don't hurry

1744
01:29:00,910 --> 01:29:03,910
Well, maybe just a half a drink more

1745
01:29:03,950 --> 01:29:06,910
Put some records on while I pour

1746
01:29:06,950 --> 01:29:09,190
The neighbors might think

1747
01:29:09,230 --> 01:29:11,190
Baby, it's bad out there

1748
01:29:11,230 --> 01:29:14,190
Say, what's in this drink?

1749
01:29:14,230 --> 01:29:17,150
No cabs to be had out there

1750
01:29:17,190 --> 01:29:18,790
I wish I knew how

1751
01:29:18,830 --> 01:29:21,110
Your eyes are like starlight now

1752
01:29:21,150 --> 01:29:22,950
To break the spell

1753
01:29:22,990 --> 01:29:27,830
I'll take your hat, your hair
looks swell

1754
01:29:27,870 --> 01:29:30,630
I ought to say no, no, no, sir

1755
01:29:30,670 --> 01:29:32,670
Mind if I move in closer?

1756
01:29:32,670 --> 01:29:35,750
At least I'm gonna say that I
tried

1757
01:29:35,790 --> 01:29:38,790
What's the sense of hurting
my pride?

1758
01:29:38,830 --> 01:29:40,630
I really can't stay

1759
01:29:40,670 --> 01:29:42,390
Baby, don't hold out

1760
01:29:42,430 --> 01:29:49,110
Ah, but it's cold outside

1761
01:29:57,070 --> 01:29:58,270
I simply must go

1762
01:29:58,270 --> 01:30:02,110
But, baby, it's cold outside

1763
01:30:02,110 --> 01:30:03,950
The answer is no

1764
01:30:03,990 --> 01:30:07,110
But, baby, it's cold outside

1765
01:30:07,150 --> 01:30:08,830
This welcome has been

1766
01:30:08,830 --> 01:30:11,430
I'm lucky that you dropped in

1767
01:30:11,470 --> 01:30:13,310
So nice and warm

1768
01:30:13,310 --> 01:30:18,150
Look out the window at that
storm

1769
01:30:18,190 --> 01:30:20,710
My sister will be suspicious

1770
01:30:20,750 --> 01:30:23,190
Gosh, your lips look delicious

1771
01:30:23,230 --> 01:30:26,310
My brother will be there at
the door

1772
01:30:26,350 --> 01:30:28,430
Waves upon tropical shore

1773
01:30:28,470 --> 01:30:31,070
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious

1774
01:30:31,110 --> 01:30:33,670
Oh, your lips look delicious

1775
01:30:33,710 --> 01:30:36,030
Well, maybe just a cigarette more

1776
01:30:36,070 --> 01:30:39,390
Never such a pleasure before

1777
01:30:39,430 --> 01:30:41,150
I've got to get home

1778
01:30:41,150 --> 01:30:43,790
But, baby, you'll freeze out there

1779
01:30:43,830 --> 01:30:45,510
Say, lend me your comb

1780
01:30:45,550 --> 01:30:49,390
It's up to your knees out there

1781
01:30:49,430 --> 01:30:51,390
You've really been grand

1782
01:30:51,430 --> 01:30:53,350
I thrill when you touch my hand

1783
01:30:53,390 --> 01:30:55,390
But don't you see

1784
01:30:55,390 --> 01:30:58,990
How can you do this thing to me?

1785
01:30:59,030 --> 01:31:02,590
There's bound to be talk tomorrow

1786
01:31:02,630 --> 01:31:05,630
Think of my lifelong sorrow

1787
01:31:05,670 --> 01:31:08,270
At least there will be plenty
implied

1788
01:31:08,310 --> 01:31:11,150
If you caught pneumonia and died

1789
01:31:11,190 --> 01:31:12,670
I really can't stay

1790
01:31:12,710 --> 01:31:15,070
Get rid of that hold out

1791
01:31:15,110 --> 01:31:18,910
Ah, but it's cold

1792
01:31:18,950 --> 01:31:24,390
Outside
