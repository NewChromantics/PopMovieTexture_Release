Open source! (ish)
---------------------------------------------
While PopMovie itself is not entirely open source, a huge amount of the code uses [SoyLib](https://github.com/SoylentGraham/SoyLib), an open source C++ library for a variety of platforms.
We endeavour to release more and more of the code as open source as time goes on.

Quick start guide
=============================================
We have provided some simple movie playback components with full power, but lots of common code written for you. If you want much more refined control, or want to handle multiple video & audio streams, consider writing your own (even using `PopMovieSimple` as a base), the interface is still quite simple!

The simple way
---------------------------------------------
+ Create a new game object in the scene and attach a `PopMovie/PopMovieSimple.cs` component
+ Create a `RenderTexture` texture to draw the movie to, or select a normal `texture2D` texture and set it on the `Target Texture` field
	+ If using a `Texture2D` you must set this to be `writable` in the advanced settings.
	+ If using a `RenderTexture` you must set the Depth Buffer setting to `No Depth Buffer`.
+ Set the `Filename` field to...
	+ To your filename `Yourfile.mp4`, and the c# code will try and resolve it to a fully qualified path, look for it in [streaming assets](http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/StreamingAssets.html), or your [persistent data path](http://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Application-persistentDataPath.html) for files [downloaded with WWW](http://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/WWW.html).
	+ Specifically to a special folder; `streamingassets:YourFile.mp4` or `persistentdata:YourFile.mp4`
	+ For Android you can use `apk:YourFile.mp4` which will explicitly load from the assets (streaming assets) in the APK, or if you have a downloaded/store updated OBB file it will look in there for the latest version
	+ Again for android, `sdcard:YourFile.mp4` looks specifically in the external storage for your file
	+ A window-capture name `window:Notepad` or `window:*`. This is only for windows or OSX
	+ A webcam or other device (microphone, phone camera etc) `device:isight` or `device:mic` or `device:*`
+ Play! Your file should load, (An exception will be thrown if it fails), auto play, and be drawn to your target texture. You can check this in the inspector. Then assign your texture to a material, cube draw to the UI, or do whatever you want with it!
+ If you want to adjust any elements (for example change aspect ratio of a UI element). Use the `GetMeta()` function to find width & height information.


Capturing Cameras & Devices
---------------------------------------------
PopMovie also captures from OS camera & capture devices. This includes microphones, phone cameras, web cameras and other devices

+ Prefix the `Filename` field with `device:` to capture.
+ `device:*` will capture from the first device it finds
+ `device:MMP` for the HTC Vive camera (This needs to be enabled in SteamVR's settings first!)
+ `device:isight` for iMac monitor Cameras
+ `device:mic` commonly gets a microphone for most platforms


Capturing Window contents
---------------------------------------------
On windows and OSX PopMovie has the ability to capture window contents and display them to your texture in realtime.

+ Prefix the `Filename` field with `window:` to capture
+ `window:*` will capture the first window with a name it finds (good for testing)
+ `window:notepad` will capture notepad if it's running
+ Window names don't have to be exact, `window:Unity` should capture unity's display.
+ OSX's window capture is currently occluded by other windows. If you want to capture a window, whilst another window sits on top, you will see the other window's contents. This does not apply to Windows
+ Window capture on Windows7 can sometimes be slow. This doesn't affect Unity's framerate, but can make applications or the contents seem laggy.
+ On Windows, there is an option named `Include Window Borders` which allows you to capture the whole window (Title bars, Minimise, close buttons etc), or just the client area
+ On Windows, you can get the full title and HWND value from `PopMovie.GetMeta()`



Features & options
=============================================
Split audio channels
---------------------------------------------
+ Added in v0.1.9
+ When this option is enabled, channels from streams are split to produce additional faux streams containing just that channels data. This allows you to place one `Audio Source` component (and therefore, position, audio mix, volume) for every channel. This works for multiple audio streams.
+ For example, splitting a stereo stream produces audio stream `0` (the original), `1` (Left) and `2` (Right).
+ A mono source would produce `0` (the orignal) and `1` (a duplicate of the original as there is only one channel)
+ Two stereo sources would produce `0` (original of stream 0), `1` (original of stream 1), `2` (Stream0 Left), `3` (stream0 right), `4`(Stream 1 Left) and `5` (stream1 right)


Problems and solutions
=============================================
In many situations enabling debug logging with `PopMovie.EnableDebugLog` will reveal problems, or hints as to any unexpected behaviour. Please check this first!

It may have unintelligible information though, so check the common problems below, or... submit an issue to [our GitHub issues page](http://www.github.com/NewChromantics/PopMovieTexture_release/issues/) (or check if it's a known problem)

You can also [send us an email directly](mailto:help@popmovie.xyz). You may have a file format or weird movie encoding that we haven't come across yet.  If nothing below solves your problem, let us know and we can fix it, and update this documentation.

Any relevant debug output will be extremely useful.
+ editor.log & console output
+ `adb logcat -s "Pop"` output for android
+ OS and Unity crash dumps
+ crash and console output from Xcode or devices on iOS & OS X.

My texture is a big gradient colour
---------------------------------------------
+ This usually indicates a runtime error. Internal shaders may not compile on your platform, or there was a problem decoding or copying the texture, turn on debug logging and you should see a message. This is quite rare now, so please email us if you cannot fix the problem!


An exception is thrown when I create my `PopMovie` class/when `PopMovieSimple` starts
---------------------------------------------
+ There was an error opening your file, or creating a decoder. Check the exception's `.message` as to what the problem is. Often the message will have OS specific errors, if these don't make sense, email us and we will try to make the errors more clear.
+ The most common cause of this is the wrong filename! Double check your spelling (remember, all files on platforms other than windows are case sensitive)
+ Streaming assets can be a special case for android. If your files are going to be in an OBB or APK, try using `apk:yourfile.mp4`.
+ see other filename prefixes in the `PopMovie` class for special handling.


My build crashes on startup or: how I learned to love DllNotFoundException
---------------------------------------------
+ On OS X this is a known issue when building a 32 bit (x86) app. Although PopMovie is built as a universal binary, it's not working. You should really be building a 64bit application anyway! We understand some other restrictions could be in place though (other plugins which HAVE to be 32 bit), let us know if this is the case and we can fix this as a priority
+ Windows is also currently 64 bit only, but this will be less trouble to correct, same as above, contact us if this is a priority for you. This should yield DllNotFoundException. If we have linked PopMovie with a 32 bit Dll, or one missing from your system you may also get this error when building 64 bit, we want to fix this!
+ Android is currently only built for Armv7. If you have an x86 device, let us know and we can work with you to get it working.
+ The Android based Epsom BT moverio is a known Armv7 device that mysteriously cannot find our library at bootup.


My texture is quite visible, but the colours are all messed up or everything is misaligned
---------------------------------------------
+ This suggests we are not merging the raw decoded image format correctly. A few options may fix, or help debug this by toggling the following options, turn off `MergeYuv`, use `Force Non-planar output`, turn off `Use Hardware decoder`, turn off `Use pixel transform`. Let us know if any of these fix, or don't fix your problem and we can look into it.

I cannot hear any audio
---------------------------------------------
+ OnAudioFilterRead in unity 5.0 on OS X in-editor sometimes doesn't output any sound, even though data is there. Some things restore it like `Debug.log(AudioData[0])` or reloading scripts. Newer versions of unity don't seem to have this issue

Audio doesn't sound correct
---------------------------------------------
+ As of `0.1.7` this should no longer be an issue on any platform. Please [contact us](mailto:help@popmovie.xyz) or [report a bug](https://github.com/NewChromantics/PopMovieTexture_Release/issues) if this is the case!
+ `Previous answer:` If the source sample rate or channel count is different from the project's audio settings, the sound won't be remuxed and will sound slow, fast or echo'y. (some platforms try to do this automatically in the hardware AAC/MP3/etc decoder) Enable debug logging to confirm the mix-match. To fix, change the your projects audio settings or re-encode the video. (Future versions will remix the audio at runtime, but the quality may not be as good)

iOS Fails to compile with undefined symbols _VTDecompressionSession...
---------------------------------------------
+ Although the UnityPackage is setup so that when you build the ios xcode project, it should add the `VideoToolbox.framework`, sometimes it doesn't.
+ If you get linker errors similar to the following, then under your project's target, under `Build Phases`, `Link Binary with Libraries`, click `[+]` and find `VideoToolbox.framework` and add it. This should exist from iOS sdk 7.0 onwards.
	+ `"_kVTDecompressionPropertyKey_RealTime", referenced from:`
	+ `"_VTDecompressionSessionCreate", referenced from:`
	+ `"_VTDecompressionSessionCanAcceptFormatDescription", referenced from:`
	+ `"_VTDecompressionSessionDecodeFrame", referenced from:`
	+ `"_VTDecompressionSessionInvalidate", referenced from:`

Gifs are not animated
---------------------------------------------
+ The current implementation of `.gif` handling only extracts the first frame of gifs. There is a new .gif decoder which essentially works, but is still slow with very large sizes, and still needs work to align frames, use alpha-compression, and generally needs moving to GPU. 
+ This may still work for your case though. For the filename, use
	+ `experimental:yourfile.gif` This currently limits you to only file access. If you require this to be accessible through HTTP or another protocol (eg. `sdcard:` `apk:`) then let me know and I can make this more public. 

CodeSigning on iOS fails
---------------------------------------------
+ When archiving an ios project (for ad-hoc or store builds), if you get the vague xcode error; `An error occurred during export; codesign failed` you may see in `Summary` that `PopMovieTextureOsx.bundle` is in the list of `Binary and Entitlements`. If this is the case, simply remove (or disable) the OSX `PopMovieTextureOsx.bundle` from your xcode project. Often unity will automatically lump this in with the iOS projects it generates.

My Vive camera (MMP) isn't found
---------------------------------------------
+ By default, this device is now disabled. Enable it in `SteamVR`, `Settings`, `Camera` and it should then be availible to PopMovie. The device name is `device:MMP`

My problem isn't listed!
---------------------------------------------
+ send us an email to [help@popmovie.xyz](mailto:help@popmovie.xyz), or [submit an issue](https://github.com/NewChromantics/PopMovieTexture_Release/issues) to the github issue tracker.
